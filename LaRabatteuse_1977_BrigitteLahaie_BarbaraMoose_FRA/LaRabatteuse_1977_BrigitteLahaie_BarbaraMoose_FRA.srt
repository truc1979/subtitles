1
00:00:13,391 --> 00:00:17,880
The Beatress (A woman who makes birds or
wild animals come out from the bushes,
so that hunters can shoot them.)

2
00:01:02,647 --> 00:01:05,736
If it's as dumb as you say,
then why are you leaving?

3
00:01:05,737 --> 00:01:07,272
Well, I'm not leaving, my darling...

4
00:01:07,346 --> 00:01:08,473
I'm being shipped away.

5
00:01:08,474 --> 00:01:10,565
It's what they call "promotion"...

6
00:01:13,001 --> 00:01:14,932
Robert, there is a favor 
I would ask of you.

7
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,179
It's partly for me,
but mostly for Jocelyne.

8
00:01:21,371 --> 00:01:23,498
Relax, she already knows about this.

9
00:01:23,499 --> 00:01:26,972
It's the reason we're having lunch together.
So you two could get acquainted.

10
00:01:26,973 --> 00:01:29,272
I would like you to take care of her,
while I'm away.

11
00:01:29,273 --> 00:01:30,736
She's a very nice girl, you'll see!

12
00:01:31,911 --> 00:01:34,095
Her problem is that
she doesn't know anyone here.

13
00:01:34,103 --> 00:01:36,020
She would be lost without you...

14
00:01:36,021 --> 00:01:38,793
If she needs anything at all,
she can call me.

15
00:01:38,999 --> 00:01:40,195
You don't understand.

16
00:01:40,196 --> 00:01:43,734
I'm asking you to take her home with you.
As a lodger.

17
00:01:43,887 --> 00:01:46,150
Robert!
Do I really need to elaborate on this?

18
00:01:46,151 --> 00:01:47,151
But...

19
00:01:47,515 --> 00:01:49,889
You know, my place is really small!

20
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,414
Oh, but she takes up very little space.

21
00:01:51,415 --> 00:01:53,354
And the space she keeps...

22
00:01:53,355 --> 00:01:55,022
She keeps really, really well.

23
00:01:55,056 --> 00:01:56,323
Isn't that true, my darling?

24
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:59,233
She really needs to take care
of someone to be happy.

25
00:01:59,234 --> 00:02:00,634
Come on, you don't really mean to say...

26
00:02:00,635 --> 00:02:02,719
that Jocelyne and I...
while you're away...

27
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,118
Well, why not?

28
00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:07,225
You'll enjoy the very special qualities
of our little friend here.

29
00:02:07,226 --> 00:02:08,226
Oh, Greg, please!

30
00:02:21,815 --> 00:02:24,188
Okay, lucky guy.
I'm leaving you with the tab.

31
00:02:24,189 --> 00:02:25,721
I guess it's worth it, right?

32
00:02:25,973 --> 00:02:27,991
No, stay seated.
I hate farewells.

33
00:02:28,311 --> 00:02:29,385
But don't forget.

34
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:31,696
I'm leaving Jocelyne in your care
while I'm away.

35
00:02:31,697 --> 00:02:33,479
But I fully intend to have her back
when i return.

36
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,480
Okay?

37
00:02:34,481 --> 00:02:35,061
Understood.

38
00:02:39,991 --> 00:02:42,273
Look around you, Robert.

39
00:02:42,547 --> 00:02:46,297
And tell me which woman you would like
to have at your place tonight.

40
00:02:46,298 --> 00:02:47,833
You, Jocelyne!

41
00:02:48,057 --> 00:02:50,867
Of course.
But...

42
00:02:51,764 --> 00:02:53,259
Here, what about that one?

43
00:02:58,596 --> 00:02:59,992
She's very beautiful.

44
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:03,318
What time would you like us
to be at your home?

45
00:03:11,038 --> 00:03:12,465
For dinner?

46
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:17,251
Oh, er, yes... for dinner.
Dinner would be good.

47
00:03:18,033 --> 00:03:19,630
Let's say, at 8 pm?

48
00:03:40,563 --> 00:03:42,605
<i>Today's forecast includes some fog.</i>

49
00:03:42,606 --> 00:03:45,660
<i>That could lead to frost on the roads.</i>

50
00:03:45,661 --> 00:03:51,467
<i>During the day, the sky will be cloudy
thoughout the nation.</i>

51
00:03:51,468 --> 00:03:53,365
<i>With some rain and snow.</i>

52
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:56,991
<i>Rain showers will reach the Alps and
the Central Mountains in the afternoon.</i>

53
00:03:56,992 --> 00:04:02,531
<i>While blustery weather is expected
from Brittany to the Paris Basin.</i>

54
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:11,063
This is my friend Inge,
a stewardess.

55
00:04:11,064 --> 00:04:12,264
Inge, this is Robert.

56
00:04:12,265 --> 00:04:13,279
Good evening.

57
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:21,465
This way.

58
00:04:27,405 --> 00:04:30,102
We're lucky that you're free tonight.

59
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:33,545
I had dinner plans with some friends
but i canceled, no problem.

60
00:04:34,696 --> 00:04:37,108
Are they appetizers?
Yes.

61
00:04:37,109 --> 00:04:39,994
In my home, appetizers...
are like this.

62
00:04:48,336 --> 00:04:50,506
It seems more appropriate to me.

63
00:04:51,789 --> 00:04:54,210
But, one need not exclude the other.

64
00:05:05,981 --> 00:05:09,553
Let's get down to serious business.
What do you think, darling?

65
00:05:11,573 --> 00:05:14,517
I mean, we should start dinner.

66
00:05:14,942 --> 00:05:17,504
Dinner is also a serious business.

67
00:05:36,883 --> 00:05:38,645
What are you talking about?

68
00:05:38,846 --> 00:05:40,444
Your pleasure.

69
00:06:00,692 --> 00:06:03,715
It's really difficult to eat
under these conditions.

70
00:06:08,874 --> 00:06:11,408
Do you want to know
what she just told me?

71
00:06:11,409 --> 00:06:13,256
No, let's just keep eating.
That will be better.

72
00:06:15,195 --> 00:06:17,106
How do you like it?

73
00:06:22,574 --> 00:06:25,076
You're gonna drive me crazy,
both of you.

74
00:06:25,268 --> 00:06:26,850
I hope so.

75
00:11:14,692 --> 00:11:17,355
- Are you satisfied?
- Shouldn't I be?

76
00:11:17,568 --> 00:11:19,559
I want to do whatever
makes you happy.

77
00:11:19,813 --> 00:11:21,595
Ask me anything you like.

78
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:25,915
Well, choose a shop and
I'll buy you a present.

79
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:30,536
A present? For no reason?
Indeed, for no reason...

80
00:12:03,185 --> 00:12:05,101
I'd like some pretty lingerie.

81
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:07,228
There is only one condition.

82
00:12:07,229 --> 00:12:08,799
You must choose them for me.

83
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,465
I must see you wearing them.

84
00:12:10,466 --> 00:12:11,766
To know if they fit you.

85
00:12:12,007 --> 00:12:13,215
You're right, sir.

86
00:12:13,355 --> 00:12:15,234
We have a little lounge
at your disposal.

87
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:17,687
And madam will be able to try 
them on, undisturbed.

88
00:12:17,688 --> 00:12:18,988
Follow me, please.

89
00:12:24,622 --> 00:12:27,114
- Who is that lady?
- A pain in the arse.

90
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:29,900
And you know what else?

91
00:12:29,901 --> 00:12:31,172
She's the Countess of Mortmolle.

92
00:12:31,173 --> 00:12:33,359
She wants to dress
like a young boy.

93
00:12:35,577 --> 00:12:38,116
Oh, that's lovely.

94
00:12:38,365 --> 00:12:40,093
It's a new model, madam.

95
00:12:40,094 --> 00:12:41,773
Absolutely lovely.

96
00:12:42,594 --> 00:12:43,668
No?

97
00:12:47,865 --> 00:12:50,690
This is the latest creation
that's just come in.

98
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:52,319
The cut is classic.

99
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,365
The clips are very simple.

100
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,173
And above all, these lovely little hearts
emphasize the breasts.

101
00:12:58,535 --> 00:13:02,456
You should try it on.
So you can feel how soft it is on your skin.

102
00:13:02,935 --> 00:13:04,309
Just one thing...

103
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:05,894
You mustn't wear anything else.

104
00:13:05,895 --> 00:13:07,346
Especially no bra.

105
00:13:07,347 --> 00:13:09,230
This design doesn't require one.

106
00:13:44,173 --> 00:13:45,796
What do you think, darling?

107
00:13:46,136 --> 00:13:47,835
What I've always thought...

108
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:51,517
A semi-dressed woman is a thousand times
more desirable.

109
00:14:00,949 --> 00:14:04,548
Could you please wear this lingerie.

110
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:06,419
That way, I can have a better look.

111
00:14:06,454 --> 00:14:08,121
Certainly, madam.

112
00:14:35,832 --> 00:14:37,616
You know, you're very pretty.

113
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:40,187
You're very beautiful.

114
00:14:40,239 --> 00:14:43,471
Maybe, madam but i prefer
when told so by a man.

115
00:14:43,472 --> 00:14:45,142
Did you hear that, Robert?

116
00:14:45,143 --> 00:14:48,524
Well, I'll tell you miss.
I'm telling you, you're very beautiful.

117
00:14:53,154 --> 00:14:56,288
They're so small, it's hardly worth
wearing them.

118
00:14:56,289 --> 00:14:57,952
But it seems that
they're very special.

119
00:14:57,953 --> 00:14:59,458
And men love them a lot.

120
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:00,559
Are you wearing any?

121
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,745
Oh no sir.
I'm wearing pantyhose.

122
00:15:02,746 --> 00:15:04,125
Oh, how awful!

123
00:15:04,126 --> 00:15:06,477
Better to wear nothing than pantyhose.

124
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,646
Look.

125
00:15:09,172 --> 00:15:11,157
I find panties indecent.

126
00:15:11,158 --> 00:15:13,943
Stockings and garter belt, okay.
But no panties, please.

127
00:15:19,165 --> 00:15:21,313
Could you please model them for us?

128
00:15:21,314 --> 00:15:24,180
By seeing them on you,
maybe we'll change our minds.

129
00:15:24,492 --> 00:15:25,732
Am I right, darling?

130
00:15:26,607 --> 00:15:28,040
Very well, madam.

131
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:31,827
Is it too much to ask of you sir
to turn your back, while i remove my pantyhose.

132
00:15:31,828 --> 00:15:34,226
Yes, it's too much to ask,
but how could i refuse?

133
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:07,648
Oh! No way madam.

134
00:17:08,478 --> 00:17:10,094
Oh no, i can't do that.

135
00:17:10,578 --> 00:17:11,980
Yes you can, miss.

136
00:17:11,981 --> 00:17:13,810
And you'll do this for me.

137
00:22:00,996 --> 00:22:06,153
I don't want to upset you, but i think
we've gone a little too far this time.

138
00:22:06,154 --> 00:22:07,957
Oh! Not at all, darling.

139
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:12,267
You know very well that
the challenge always excites me.

140
00:22:12,653 --> 00:22:15,923
And as promised,
tonight she'll be here.

141
00:22:16,373 --> 00:22:18,505
Completely naked under her dress.

142
00:22:18,575 --> 00:22:20,696
And ready to fulfill
all your desires.

143
00:22:21,831 --> 00:22:24,081
Submissive and perverted
like a hooker.

144
00:22:24,082 --> 00:22:25,282
Well, we can only hope.

145
00:22:25,283 --> 00:22:28,009
If it's like you say,
then anything is possible.

146
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:29,584
Anything is possible!

147
00:22:29,585 --> 00:22:31,439
You only need ask and I shall do.

148
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:41,873
How do i look?

149
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:45,967
Very beautiful.

150
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,607
Very well.

151
00:22:49,299 --> 00:22:52,383
We'll be here tonight at 9 pm.

152
00:23:18,391 --> 00:23:20,756
Ah good evening, your Ladyship.

153
00:23:20,757 --> 00:23:23,949
Robert, I'll permit you to call me Géraldine.

154
00:23:26,649 --> 00:23:28,455
Oh! A Kandinsky!

155
00:23:28,787 --> 00:23:31,571
I already feel good here,
my dear Robert.

156
00:23:31,572 --> 00:23:33,389
Please come in, your Ladyship.

157
00:23:34,149 --> 00:23:35,402
It's lovely.

158
00:23:36,151 --> 00:23:38,341
Oh! It's wonderful!

159
00:23:40,302 --> 00:23:41,962
It's really lovely.

160
00:23:42,184 --> 00:23:44,745
What a wonderful apartment
you have, Robert.

161
00:23:44,746 --> 00:23:46,349
Countess, would you like a drink?

162
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:49,200
Yes please, my dear.
A Whiskey Coke, if you have one.

163
00:23:49,201 --> 00:23:50,205
Of course.

164
00:24:31,512 --> 00:24:34,256
Géraldine please,
all in good time.

165
00:24:35,002 --> 00:24:36,938
Would you like to dine now?

166
00:24:36,939 --> 00:24:39,913
My dear Robert,
I'd prefer to dine later.

167
00:24:39,914 --> 00:24:41,106
As you wish.

168
00:24:41,194 --> 00:24:42,885
Do you collect them?

169
00:24:42,886 --> 00:24:43,886
No, not exactly.

170
00:24:43,887 --> 00:24:46,913
They're birthday presents.
From many birthdays.

171
00:24:46,914 --> 00:24:48,113
What a great idea!

172
00:24:48,114 --> 00:24:52,400
Now I know what present I'll give for
the birthday of my dear François Xavier.

173
00:24:52,401 --> 00:24:53,933
That's my husband.

174
00:24:56,279 --> 00:24:58,559
Oh! This one is so funny!

175
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,243
It'll be funnier when
you get it up the ass.

176
00:25:01,244 --> 00:25:04,482
Aah! That's where this little thing goes?

177
00:25:09,721 --> 00:25:14,290
My dear Robert, you must never get bored
with all these items?

178
00:25:14,291 --> 00:25:16,321
But Robert uses other things.

179
00:25:16,322 --> 00:25:19,363
These items are here
just for decoration.

180
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:20,868
Too bad!

181
00:25:20,869 --> 00:25:24,824
If you want we can bring them out,
to give them some fresh air.

182
00:25:24,825 --> 00:25:27,106
These little things included.

183
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,595
No, Countess.

184
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:34,203
You know that you should not
make the first move.

185
00:25:34,204 --> 00:25:35,652
You promised me.

186
00:25:35,968 --> 00:25:39,196
You're here to do everything
my master asks of you.

187
00:25:39,197 --> 00:25:40,392
And to do it well.

188
00:25:40,393 --> 00:25:42,913
I'm sorry Jocelyne but
I have a fiery temper.

189
00:25:42,914 --> 00:25:44,950
Then, suck me Countess.

190
00:25:52,711 --> 00:25:54,346
With pleasure.

191
00:27:06,036 --> 00:27:07,937
Undress me, Countess.

192
00:29:00,407 --> 00:29:04,803
Your Ladyship, I am pleased to announce
that you're about to get fucked.

193
00:29:04,804 --> 00:29:06,004
And that's a promise.

194
00:29:06,685 --> 00:29:09,839
Promise me Robert. But above all, do it.

195
00:31:51,349 --> 00:31:53,205
You're really just a big slut.

196
00:31:53,206 --> 00:31:57,550
Oh yeah, baby. It seems that
I'm one of a kind.

197
00:32:06,249 --> 00:32:07,688
You like that huh?

198
00:32:27,407 --> 00:32:29,467
I just phoned our dear Countess.

199
00:32:29,468 --> 00:32:32,023
She had a hard time
explaining away her little escapade.

200
00:32:32,121 --> 00:32:34,219
Especially considering her condition
when she got home.

201
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,318
That's her problem.

202
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:36,819
Was she satisfied, at least?

203
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:38,742
So much so, that
she wants to see you again.

204
00:32:38,743 --> 00:32:39,807
Well, to see us again.

205
00:32:39,808 --> 00:32:40,808
Out of the question!

206
00:32:41,075 --> 00:32:42,980
Once is fun, but twice, no!

207
00:32:43,454 --> 00:32:44,793
I'm counting on you in this, okay?

208
00:32:45,291 --> 00:32:49,484
As you know, part of my mission is to prevent 
them from "breaking your balls," as you say.

209
00:32:52,639 --> 00:32:54,545
Do you think they're mother and daughter?

210
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:57,472
The only way to know for sure,
is to ask them.

211
00:32:57,964 --> 00:32:59,582
Tell me, do you like them?

212
00:33:04,433 --> 00:33:05,612
They are charming.

213
00:33:07,341 --> 00:33:09,239
And you want both, of course?

214
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,591
If they're really mother and daughter,
that would seem difficult.

215
00:33:12,018 --> 00:33:14,371
Nope... not a problem, my dear.

216
00:33:15,336 --> 00:33:18,085
- Let's say, 9 pm?
- You're crazy.

217
00:33:18,176 --> 00:33:19,386
Yes, crazy about you.

218
00:33:21,361 --> 00:33:22,668
Come on, get lost.

219
00:34:05,697 --> 00:34:08,099
Hello, yes.
Ah, it's you!

220
00:34:08,915 --> 00:34:10,676
So, is there a problem?

221
00:34:10,908 --> 00:34:12,914
They really were mother and daughter.

222
00:34:12,915 --> 00:34:15,415
And you're calling me to tell me,
it's not working.

223
00:34:16,842 --> 00:34:19,137
You've finally hit a snag, honey.

224
00:34:19,138 --> 00:34:20,760
You're losing your touch.

225
00:34:22,564 --> 00:34:24,501
Come home, I'm waiting for you.

226
00:34:24,836 --> 00:34:26,311
What are you saying?

227
00:34:27,508 --> 00:34:28,949
Yes, let me write it down.

228
00:34:33,109 --> 00:34:34,676
Street...

229
00:34:36,118 --> 00:34:37,258
Yes.

230
00:34:37,672 --> 00:34:38,875
At what time?

231
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:41,713
All right, I'll finish my shower
and come over right away.

232
00:34:42,992 --> 00:34:44,798
A surprise?

233
00:34:45,245 --> 00:34:47,377
At least, tell me what it is?

234
00:34:49,183 --> 00:34:50,274
Hello?

235
00:34:51,166 --> 00:34:52,124
Hello?

236
00:34:53,015 --> 00:34:54,220
Shit.

237
00:35:17,985 --> 00:35:19,352
Good evening, darling.

238
00:35:20,109 --> 00:35:21,727
Will you tell me what's going on already?

239
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:23,344
Come in and I'll tell you everything.

240
00:35:25,311 --> 00:35:26,634
What is this place anyway?

241
00:35:26,727 --> 00:35:28,680
Have a little patience, my darling.

242
00:35:28,681 --> 00:35:30,306
I told you it was a surprise!

243
00:35:30,538 --> 00:35:31,907
Come on, follow me.

244
00:35:36,679 --> 00:35:38,687
- I don't believe it!
- Yes, it's true.

245
00:35:38,688 --> 00:35:41,727
Allow me to introduce Edith
and her daughter Émilie.

246
00:35:41,728 --> 00:35:43,320
Good evening Robert.

247
00:35:44,703 --> 00:35:47,859
Welcome to our home. Please excuse 
us for insisting you come here.

248
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:49,282
We feel cosier at home.

249
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:52,946
And it is proper for the ladies 
to be receiving, anyway.

250
00:35:56,665 --> 00:35:58,976
So, it seems nothing is impossible 
after all, sweetheart?

251
00:35:58,977 --> 00:36:02,026
All three of us are here
for your pleasure...

252
00:36:02,866 --> 00:36:05,955
- It's your favorite brand.
- Correct.

253
00:36:09,987 --> 00:36:13,459
You see, thanks to Jocelyne,
we know everything about you.

254
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,963
You should feel at home here.

255
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:18,032
Just ask and we shall do as you please.

256
00:36:18,033 --> 00:36:19,631
They know everything about you.

257
00:36:19,632 --> 00:36:22,571
But you too must known certain things.

258
00:36:22,572 --> 00:36:24,505
Especially about Émilie.

259
00:36:24,506 --> 00:36:26,352
To your health, Émilie.

260
00:36:27,383 --> 00:36:28,984
Émilie is a virgin.

261
00:36:31,073 --> 00:36:32,865
Well... almost.

262
00:36:32,866 --> 00:36:35,437
She has never made love with a man.

263
00:36:35,438 --> 00:36:39,313
And I'm very happy that you'll be
the first one to take her, Robert.

264
00:36:39,314 --> 00:36:40,681
And what does Émilie think of this?

265
00:36:40,682 --> 00:36:42,903
Since it must happen at some point...

266
00:36:43,671 --> 00:36:45,841
I would like it to be with you...

267
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:48,740
If you agree, of course.

268
00:36:49,693 --> 00:36:51,330
Émilie is young.

269
00:36:54,603 --> 00:36:57,849
But she's a real woman already.
Look!

270
00:37:02,669 --> 00:37:04,315
And her legs...

271
00:37:08,187 --> 00:37:10,163
She knows many things.

272
00:37:10,164 --> 00:37:12,293
And you can ask almost anything of her.

273
00:37:12,294 --> 00:37:15,153
Unless you prefer that Edith show the way.

274
00:37:15,701 --> 00:37:18,857
I have a feeling that wonderful things
are going to happen here.

275
00:37:18,858 --> 00:37:20,250
What do you think, Edith?

276
00:37:20,251 --> 00:37:22,765
Just ask, Robert, just ask!

277
00:39:56,235 --> 00:39:58,667
I would really like Robert to take me now...

278
00:40:01,014 --> 00:40:04,590
Émilie is getting impatient.
She would like you to take her now!

279
00:40:05,338 --> 00:40:08,279
Maybe it would be best
if we moved to the bedroom.

280
00:48:35,166 --> 00:48:37,146
I like that black girl very much.

281
00:48:37,625 --> 00:48:40,770
Can I at least finish watching the movie?
Of course.

282
00:49:15,642 --> 00:49:17,636
My name is Baron da Marie.

283
00:49:17,637 --> 00:49:19,828
- And you? Are you Robert?
- Yes, I'm Robert.

284
00:49:19,829 --> 00:49:23,059
- And her, she's Jocelyne.
- Yes, we already know each other.

285
00:49:30,030 --> 00:49:31,769
Oh, you have a beautiful house.

286
00:49:31,770 --> 00:49:33,855
This is the kind of house
I would like to have.

287
00:49:33,856 --> 00:49:35,369
May I touch?

288
00:49:35,674 --> 00:49:37,051
Yes, you may touch.

289
00:49:37,291 --> 00:49:39,055
What do you do for a living?

290
00:49:39,056 --> 00:49:40,810
Nothing very interesting.

291
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:43,473
So, you do nothing.
Well, i'm an usherette.

292
00:49:43,474 --> 00:49:45,893
I place people.
That's really pleasant.

293
00:49:45,967 --> 00:49:48,661
And they are always nice with me.

294
00:49:48,762 --> 00:49:51,019
- Do you go to the movies?
- Sometimes.

295
00:49:51,979 --> 00:49:55,189
I watch all the movies with
Mr. Jean-Paul and Mr. Alain.

296
00:49:55,384 --> 00:49:57,852
- Jean-Paul Belmondo and Alain Delon.
- Ah, Yes.

297
00:49:57,853 --> 00:50:01,120
- And do you like them?
- Oh yes! They are beautiful.

298
00:50:01,121 --> 00:50:03,105
And they are so nice.

299
00:50:03,106 --> 00:50:04,748
But they're always in trouble.

300
00:50:04,749 --> 00:50:08,481
I'd like to kiss them everywhere.
Can you arrange that?

301
00:50:08,798 --> 00:50:11,783
Robert can do a lot of things,
if you ask nicely.

302
00:50:11,784 --> 00:50:14,393
I'll do anything you want me to do.
If you can arrange it.

303
00:50:14,394 --> 00:50:15,809
And if i can't?

304
00:50:15,810 --> 00:50:18,842
It doesn't matter,
I'll still do anything.

305
00:50:21,017 --> 00:50:22,953
How does this machine work?

306
00:50:23,886 --> 00:50:26,277
Make it work for me.

307
00:50:38,552 --> 00:50:42,059
Turn off those lights
and I'll dance for you.

308
01:03:05,957 --> 01:03:08,570
I want this one naked
under a black raincoat.

309
01:03:08,571 --> 01:03:11,701
Stockings and garters?
Black stockings and black garters.

310
01:03:11,702 --> 01:03:13,763
I'll see you at home.

311
01:03:33,462 --> 01:03:38,337
Hi beautiful. It doesn't work every time, eh?
Lost your touch, maybe?

312
01:03:38,846 --> 01:03:42,066
Oh, no I didn't,
and it still works!

313
01:03:44,848 --> 01:03:45,934
Come in!

314
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:49,576
Allow me to introduce Robert.

315
01:03:49,577 --> 01:03:52,233
And this is Nadine.
Good evening, Nadine.

316
01:03:52,234 --> 01:03:53,325
Good evening.

317
01:03:57,987 --> 01:03:59,321
Please come in.

318
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:10,166
Darling, it does still work, 
but there is a small problem.

319
01:04:10,562 --> 01:04:12,282
Really? Is she maybe menstruating?

320
01:04:12,469 --> 01:04:16,110
No sir, but i can't spend
the entire night here.

321
01:04:16,111 --> 01:04:17,915
She must return home fairly early.

322
01:04:17,916 --> 01:04:19,656
A jealous husband, perhaps?

323
01:04:19,657 --> 01:04:21,117
Not yet...

324
01:04:21,369 --> 01:04:25,902
Well, actually, I'm getting married
tomorrow morning, at ten!

325
01:04:27,951 --> 01:04:30,856
Last evening as a single woman?
This calls for a party!

326
01:04:30,857 --> 01:04:35,287
Nadine, believe us.
Jocelyne and I are going to outdo ourselves!

327
01:04:35,288 --> 01:04:36,574
Champagne!

328
01:04:36,575 --> 01:04:37,575
Music!

329
01:04:47,606 --> 01:04:49,380
Where are they?

330
01:04:50,622 --> 01:04:52,836
My darlings, the Champagne is ready.

331
01:05:07,051 --> 01:05:10,181
You can't watch, wait for us out there.
But the Champagne?

332
01:05:10,182 --> 01:05:11,836
Keep it fresh.

333
01:05:12,209 --> 01:05:14,979
Please, let us prepare
for your pleasure.

334
01:05:22,092 --> 01:05:24,339
Panties or no panties?
No panties.

335
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:25,640
It's more beautiful for a bride.

336
01:05:25,641 --> 01:05:27,016
Yes, but tomorrow I'll wear them.

337
01:05:27,017 --> 01:05:28,913
Or else my Albert
will not understand.

338
01:05:28,914 --> 01:05:31,187
For him, a bride must be
all in white.

339
01:10:45,018 --> 01:10:46,694
Shit! What is it?

340
01:10:47,717 --> 01:10:49,155
Maybe a wrong number.

341
01:10:49,665 --> 01:10:51,999
- Maybe an ex-girlfriend?
- Yes, maybe.

342
01:10:52,405 --> 01:10:53,078
I'll go.

343
01:10:53,079 --> 01:10:55,912
No, you stay here and
take care of our bride.

344
01:11:58,938 --> 01:12:00,941
Sorry to bother you, sir.

345
01:12:00,942 --> 01:12:03,711
Her Ladyship saw the light on.

346
01:12:03,712 --> 01:12:05,893
She wants to know if
she could visit now.

347
01:12:05,894 --> 01:12:07,651
She would be very pleased.

348
01:12:07,982 --> 01:12:10,438
Send her up.
She'll be properly welcomed.

349
01:12:11,204 --> 01:12:14,134
I have no doubt about it.
I'll tell her right away.

350
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:17,868
- Have you ever fucked the Countess?
- You can't be serious?

351
01:12:17,869 --> 01:12:18,939
Yes or no?

352
01:12:20,001 --> 01:12:21,624
Unfortunately, no sir.

353
01:12:21,625 --> 01:12:24,071
Do you at least know
how to behave?

354
01:12:25,411 --> 01:12:27,649
Almost as well as you do, sir.

355
01:12:29,156 --> 01:12:32,990
Okay, take this key and
make a discreet entrance later.

356
01:12:33,785 --> 01:12:36,933
It will be done.
As you say, sir.
