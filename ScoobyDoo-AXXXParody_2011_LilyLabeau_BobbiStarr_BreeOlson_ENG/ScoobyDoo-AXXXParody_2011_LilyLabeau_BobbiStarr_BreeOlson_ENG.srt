00:00:11,739 --> 00:00:14,064
(snores)

3
00:00:15,631 --> 00:00:18,476
Oh Scoob, old buddy

4
00:00:19,296 --> 00:00:21,921
We need to get a place
that doesn't spin.

5
00:00:25,368 --> 00:00:26,835
Ouch, my head.

6
00:00:27,422 --> 00:00:30,123
Why do I always smoke so much
when I drink...? (♪)

7
00:00:31,024 --> 00:00:33,539
Or do I always drink so much
when I smoke...?

8
00:00:33,872 --> 00:00:35,789
(flute playing) 
Oh... Why does it hurt to think?

9
00:00:37,659 --> 00:00:40,694
Scoob?
Scoob, old buddy?

10
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:42,944
Scoob, old boy?

11
00:00:45,146 --> 00:00:46,749
Scoob?... Scoob?

12
00:00:47,561 --> 00:00:50,277
Scooby-Doo?... Where are you?
(thunder rumbles)

13
00:00:51,435 --> 00:00:53,435
(creepy laugh and music organ playing)

14
00:01:10,689 --> 00:01:11,689
(♪)

15
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
(♪)

16
00:02:22,982 --> 00:02:23,982
(music end)

17
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:29,470
He's gone.
What am I gonna do?

18
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,600
Where did you see him last?

19
00:02:32,275 --> 00:02:34,267
Last night. I think.

20
00:02:35,408 --> 00:02:36,276
You think?

21
00:02:37,733 --> 00:02:40,165
Well, yeah...
I was at this Halloween party

22
00:02:40,342 --> 00:02:41,673
And there were things...

23
00:02:42,305 --> 00:02:44,025
What kind of things, Shagg?

24
00:02:44,588 --> 00:02:46,396
Things... you know... stuff.

25
00:02:47,078 --> 00:02:50,537
- Ah... Drugs and alcohol.
- Yes.

26
00:02:50,747 --> 00:02:52,656
And boobs.
A lot of boobs.

27
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,539
And vagina.
Vaginas everywhere.

28
00:02:55,681 --> 00:02:58,425
Does anyone else feeling nauseous?

29
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:02,575
So tell us what you remember
from the party. In details.

30
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:05,742
Okay... I was at this party ...

31
00:03:05,743 --> 00:03:06,709
And there were boobs.

32
00:03:07,346 --> 00:03:09,047
Yes. And vagina.

33
00:03:09,072 --> 00:03:11,669
Gosh,
can we believe to move on here?

34
00:03:11,927 --> 00:03:15,636
Okay, okay. I was at the spooky
Halloween party...

35
00:03:17,686 --> 00:03:19,153
(techno music playing)

36
00:03:20,135 --> 00:03:22,202
(background indistinct chatter)

37
00:03:24,984 --> 00:03:26,451
(music getting louder)

38
00:04:01,498 --> 00:04:02,029
Oh!

39
00:04:02,053 --> 00:04:04,463
Hi, I'm Sindy.

40
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:09,538
That's S... I... N... di.

41
00:04:10,535 --> 00:04:14,449
- Hello Sindh.
- Dy! Sindy!

42
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:19,397
- Do you want to party with me?
- Do I want a party with you?

43
00:04:20,395 --> 00:04:21,956
Or should we just fuck?

44
00:04:22,756 --> 00:04:24,148
Or should we just ...

45
00:04:25,115 --> 00:04:28,353
Let's fuck first.
There's all night to party.

46
00:04:29,721 --> 00:04:35,005
Wow! I must be really high, Scoob.
Naked Fairy wants to fuck me.

47
00:04:35,661 --> 00:04:37,260
Reality check please.

48
00:04:41,647 --> 00:04:43,284
Cocktail sir?

49
00:04:44,574 --> 00:04:46,991
- Is this reality is enough for you?
- Zoinks!

50
00:04:47,824 --> 00:04:49,790
That's a pretty weird
reality check, buddy.

51
00:04:50,232 --> 00:04:51,315
Who's Scoob?

52
00:04:52,331 --> 00:04:54,163
- Well, he's just my...
- Don't say.

53
00:04:54,764 --> 00:04:56,635
Your friend can come up later.

54
00:04:57,153 --> 00:05:00,261
Maybe if he's cute,
I'll fuck you both.

55
00:05:00,838 --> 00:05:02,086
But he's a...

56
00:05:05,335 --> 00:05:06,802
(techno music playing)

57
00:05:09,426 --> 00:05:12,771
Enough, enough!
I do not need to hear this!

58
00:05:12,882 --> 00:05:13,671
I do!

59
00:05:14,128 --> 00:05:14,680
I mean ...

60
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:15,890
We should hear everything.

61
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,848
So did you and Scoob had sex
with that girl?

62
00:05:19,046 --> 00:05:21,870
Wow! What?
No, no.

63
00:05:22,077 --> 00:05:23,334
What is wrong with--

64
00:05:23,343 --> 00:05:26,469
Oh! excuse me
while I go throw up.

65
00:05:26,605 --> 00:05:28,540
Somebody is pregnant.

66
00:05:29,174 --> 00:05:32,005
Somebody is clinically retarded.

67
00:05:32,364 --> 00:05:35,690
- Sticks and stones...
- Don't tempt me.

68
00:05:37,174 --> 00:05:39,605
Girls, focus.
(door closes)

69
00:05:39,698 --> 00:05:42,421
- Shagg, continue please.
- Okay

70
00:05:43,053 --> 00:05:46,051
(♪) Hmm...
She was on top of me and ...

71
00:05:47,321 --> 00:05:48,321
(drums playing)

72
00:05:49,635 --> 00:05:51,352
This place is kind of creepy.

73
00:05:52,126 --> 00:05:53,326
It's Halloween.

74
00:05:54,119 --> 00:05:55,993
Now shut up and fuck me.

75
00:05:58,504 --> 00:05:59,837
(rock music playing)

76
00:20:20,081 --> 00:20:21,814
(intriguing music playing)

77
00:20:22,339 --> 00:20:26,063
So you actually came on her body.
After how long?

78
00:20:27,582 --> 00:20:28,809
About an hour.

79
00:20:29,147 --> 00:20:31,626
So you can have sex
for a full hour?

80
00:20:32,101 --> 00:20:33,946
Is it possible
you've lost track of time?

81
00:20:34,329 --> 00:20:37,285
What is this about
her having multiple orgasms?

82
00:20:37,386 --> 00:20:38,774
Are you currently hallucinating?

83
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:41,249
Look guys,
I have a very big dick

84
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:43,887
and can go
for a long time without cuming.

85
00:20:43,887 --> 00:20:46,636
(VELMA: Oooh shit...)

86
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:49,092
Velma, are you okay?

87
00:20:49,955 --> 00:20:51,500
(VELMA: I-I'm fine.)

88
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:53,607
What was that sound?

89
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:57,400
Sound?
What sound?

90
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,192
It sounded like a
"Ah, shit!"?

91
00:21:01,314 --> 00:21:03,275
Well, I lost my contact lenses.

92
00:21:04,068 --> 00:21:05,984
- But you ...
- You wear glasses.

93
00:21:06,009 --> 00:21:07,837
- No contact lenses.
- Right.

94
00:21:08,371 --> 00:21:12,586
Because I lost them.
Just now... Again.

95
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:13,563
(♪)

96
00:21:13,748 --> 00:21:14,931
I'll find them.

97
00:21:15,282 --> 00:21:17,422
That's what I do: I find stuff.

98
00:21:17,665 --> 00:21:21,199
Oh no, no, no, no. There's no need.
You don't have to.

99
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,847
I got this.
What did they look like?

100
00:21:22,923 --> 00:21:26,802
Hmm, thin... clear...
mostly invisible.

101
00:21:27,003 --> 00:21:28,748
Invisible.
Got it.

102
00:21:31,204 --> 00:21:32,882
Are we done
with this part of the story?

103
00:21:32,907 --> 00:21:33,989
What happened next?

104
00:21:34,038 --> 00:21:37,205
(DAPHNE: I found them! Ah no, wait,
it's just water.)

105
00:21:37,277 --> 00:21:38,436
Look, I'm not sure.

106
00:21:38,461 --> 00:21:40,830
I don't even remember
how I got back home.

107
00:21:40,907 --> 00:21:44,820
But you so clearly remember
all the details of the sex?

108
00:21:45,986 --> 00:21:47,945
Men! *Grrr!*

109
00:21:49,055 --> 00:21:50,972
Did I miss anything important?

110
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,797
(DAPHANIE + FRED FOREVER)

111
00:21:54,202 --> 00:21:56,505
This is useless as usual!

112
00:21:57,311 --> 00:21:58,163
(♪) Fred!

113
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:02,174
Boob, vagina
and a three-way ...

114
00:22:02,804 --> 00:22:06,645
What the fuck people?
Get on the case!

115
00:22:07,714 --> 00:22:08,846
Let me see your notes!

116
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:11,619
Nothing!

117
00:22:12,733 --> 00:22:13,615
Why is it wet?

118
00:22:16,592 --> 00:22:17,818
This smells like pus--

119
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:20,277
Were there any distinguishing marks
on her body?

120
00:22:20,326 --> 00:22:21,801
We need to find this slut. (end ♪)

121
00:22:23,235 --> 00:22:25,348
Well, I'm not totally sure,
but I...

122
00:22:25,793 --> 00:22:28,384
I think I remember a birthmark
by her vagina.

123
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,279
So you want us to go
to every hospital

124
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:35,113
and find out who's born
with a birthmark on her the vagina?

125
00:22:35,461 --> 00:22:38,129
(DAPHNE: I have birthmark on my vagina.)

126
00:22:38,973 --> 00:22:42,542
(No, wait, I don't. My bad.)

127
00:22:43,724 --> 00:22:46,712
(♪) She could have been born
at any hospital in the world.

128
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,437
Do you have a better idea?
A phone number perhaps?

129
00:22:51,026 --> 00:22:53,541
I have an idea.
Did you shower yet?

130
00:22:53,818 --> 00:22:55,399
Maybe you have a DNA on your junk.

131
00:22:55,602 --> 00:22:56,658
*Uuurk* (door closes)

132
00:22:57,764 --> 00:23:00,178
Why don't we just go
to the mansion and ask around?

133
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:02,247
Surely someone has seen
a Great Dane.

134
00:23:02,929 --> 00:23:04,729
Ok, we can do that.

135
00:23:04,763 --> 00:23:07,104
Yes, maybe the slut
will still be there.

136
00:23:07,414 --> 00:23:09,081
You seem a little angry Velma.

137
00:23:09,631 --> 00:23:10,954
Is it "that" time?

138
00:23:11,482 --> 00:23:12,766
She is pregnant.

139
00:23:13,442 --> 00:23:14,807
*Uuurgh*

140
00:23:15,533 --> 00:23:18,523
What did I do
to deserve you, people?

141
00:23:19,025 --> 00:23:23,434
Speaking of pregnant,
it's high noon and ovulating vow

142
00:23:24,435 --> 00:23:28,121
Can we cut with the pregnant crap?
I'm not pregnant.

143
00:23:28,436 --> 00:23:29,469
"Ovu"-what?

144
00:23:30,454 --> 00:23:32,995
What she means is:
it's time for us to have sex

145
00:23:33,738 --> 00:23:35,912
We're gonna make babies,
Uh 'Fredles'.

146
00:23:36,639 --> 00:23:37,639
Fredles?

147
00:23:38,132 --> 00:23:40,520
Yes Dear, we just need
to keep trying new ways.

148
00:23:41,032 --> 00:23:43,741
Does this mean we're not gonna have
sex in my ass anymore?

149
00:23:43,742 --> 00:23:45,356
Because I don't think that's working.

150
00:23:46,597 --> 00:23:49,543
Well... But if I cum in your mouth
and you swallow,

151
00:23:49,644 --> 00:23:51,014
They'll go right down in your tummy

152
00:23:51,445 --> 00:23:52,789
- Where the baby is.
- Where the baby is.

153
00:23:53,446 --> 00:23:56,499
Shagg, what's the best place
to give my girl what she needs?

154
00:23:57,238 --> 00:24:00,742
- Haven't you tried them all?
- Free clinic?

155
00:24:01,365 --> 00:24:03,634
I'm gonna take her downtown
to meet Freddy Brown.

156
00:24:04,124 --> 00:24:05,488
I have no idea what that means,

157
00:24:05,513 --> 00:24:07,273
because all my blood
is in my penis right now.

158
00:24:07,583 --> 00:24:09,357
Time's ticking.

159
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:12,265
VELMA: No! No!

160
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:17,906
They're not gonna do it right here...
I can just feel the mental scarring

161
00:24:18,269 --> 00:24:21,880
I think I'm still totally high.
Reality check!

162
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:29,602
Oh! I'm in a safe and happy place.
I'm in a safe and happy place.

163
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:32,395
Have I been a good girl for you?

164
00:24:33,687 --> 00:24:35,729
Oh yeah, take off your clothing.

165
00:38:05,532 --> 00:38:08,256
Are you ready?

166
00:38:38,291 --> 00:38:40,657
So... Do you think I'm pregnant now?

167
00:38:40,966 --> 00:38:41,951
(♪) Well sweetheart...

168
00:38:41,976 --> 00:38:43,791
You definitely got the cum
where the babies go

169
00:38:45,934 --> 00:38:48,908
- Did that just happen?
- I believe it did.

170
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,104
Your hand is on my crotch.

171
00:38:53,644 --> 00:38:56,083
Oh... I'm...
You're very ...

172
00:38:56,507 --> 00:38:59,616
Haar... Oh my God!
Oh my God!

173
00:38:59,771 --> 00:39:03,419
I mean I... I didn't… I wasn't
I just… Hmm…

174
00:39:03,447 --> 00:39:05,678
It's okay.
I kind of liked it.

175
00:39:07,531 --> 00:39:08,631
You... You did?

176
00:39:09,099 --> 00:39:11,028
I mean, of course you did!
Pervert.

177
00:39:11,467 --> 00:39:15,653
Put that big... firm...
Thing away!

178
00:39:16,043 --> 00:39:17,627
We have a mystery to solve!

179
00:39:17,786 --> 00:39:18,786
(drums intro)

180
00:39:21,511 --> 00:39:22,511
(♪)

181
00:39:25,144 --> 00:39:28,408
- Are you sure this is the place?
- What a place!

182
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:30,211
Pretty sure this is the place.

183
00:39:30,418 --> 00:39:31,616
This is the place

184
00:39:31,641 --> 00:39:34,351
where you screwed that girl
for hours?

185
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:36,051
Can you please not?

186
00:39:36,076 --> 00:39:39,496
He said he gave her
multiple orgasms.

187
00:39:39,773 --> 00:39:42,318
Do you have a "off" button?

188
00:39:42,343 --> 00:39:43,412
FRED: 
Ladies, please.

189
00:39:43,749 --> 00:39:44,983
We need to search for clues.

190
00:39:45,767 --> 00:39:46,679
(mysterious music playing)

191
00:39:47,229 --> 00:39:49,318
Scoob has probably decided
to move on.

192
00:39:49,842 --> 00:39:52,301
You are kidding.
Let's try to find a way in.

193
00:39:55,776 --> 00:39:56,776
(♪)

194
00:39:59,068 --> 00:39:59,804
FRED:
Alright,

195
00:39:59,829 --> 00:40:02,553
Velma you go around the side
see if there's another door.

196
00:40:02,741 --> 00:40:03,466
Shaggy,

197
00:40:03,491 --> 00:40:05,424
you climb the roof,
to see if there's an open window.

198
00:40:05,712 --> 00:40:07,819
I go around the back to see 
if there's another way in.

199
00:40:10,228 --> 00:40:12,452
(door creaking)

200
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:17,502
Come on gang, I found a way in.

201
00:40:18,273 --> 00:40:19,606
(harp intro playing)

202
00:40:30,313 --> 00:40:31,313
(♪)

203
00:40:35,314 --> 00:40:37,547
I love what they've done
with the place.

204
00:40:38,448 --> 00:40:42,051
Alright gang, let's split up.
Till we can find some clues.

205
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:44,433
(intriguing music playing)

206
00:41:27,415 --> 00:41:28,415
(♪)

207
00:42:06,862 --> 00:42:09,105
Hey gang, you find any clues?

208
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:11,391
- No, not a clue.
- Nope

209
00:42:12,058 --> 00:42:12,867
(♪)

210
00:42:12,891 --> 00:42:14,274
Quick, hide!
Someone is coming!

211
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:19,752
(suspense sounds)

212
00:42:21,711 --> 00:42:22,711
(♪)

213
00:42:23,896 --> 00:42:25,098
This is bad.

214
00:42:25,757 --> 00:42:27,154
A demon has taken Scoob.

215
00:42:27,531 --> 00:42:28,155
Shhh!

216
00:42:28,486 --> 00:42:32,486
Shut up and get back inside
before someone or something sees us.

217
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:36,250
(♪)

218
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,120
Ah!

219
00:42:48,204 --> 00:42:49,465
A baby.

220
00:42:50,787 --> 00:42:53,572
(background roar)
You are so cute

221
00:42:57,990 --> 00:43:02,573
(short scary music)

222
00:43:08,363 --> 00:43:10,623
Like this is a pretty odd time
to change your underwear.

223
00:43:10,722 --> 00:43:14,389
I'm tired of pretending Shaggy.
I'm very attracted to you.

224
00:43:14,507 --> 00:43:18,590
When you told that story,
I've got so turned on.

225
00:43:19,042 --> 00:43:24,441
- Somebody's pregnant...
- Somebody is clinically retarded.

226
00:43:24,633 --> 00:43:26,191
Sticks and stones...

227
00:43:26,592 --> 00:43:28,127
Don't tempt me.

228
00:43:28,677 --> 00:43:30,744
(FRED: Girls, focus.) (door closes)

229
00:43:31,195 --> 00:43:34,011
(- continue please.)
(- SHAGGY: Okay.)

230
00:43:34,593 --> 00:43:36,669
(Hmm... She was on top of me...)

231
00:43:37,597 --> 00:43:38,996
(That girl turnt crazy!)

232
00:43:39,698 --> 00:43:44,720
(I don't even know what to do.
She rode me cowgirl two days sideways)

233
00:43:45,099 --> 00:43:47,296
(I never been ridden like that before
by anyone)

234
00:43:47,821 --> 00:43:50,577
(And I banged doggy doggy from behind)

235
00:43:51,328 --> 00:43:53,478
(I wish Scoob was there to see.)

236
00:43:53,793 --> 00:43:56,253
(But he was missing
nowhere to be found)

237
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:39,119
(But anyways, in the end,

238
00:46:39,144 --> 00:46:42,244
(I must've a huge blow all over her face
and her tits and--

239
00:46:42,269 --> 00:46:46,665
(chicks loves take that shit off
literally and metaphorically)

240
00:46:47,451 --> 00:46:51,482
(FRED: So, you actually came on 
her body, after how long?)

241
00:46:52,714 --> 00:46:53,890
(SHAGGY: About an hour)

242
00:46:54,198 --> 00:46:56,864
(DAPHNE: So you can have sex
for a full hour?)

243
00:46:57,228 --> 00:46:59,127
(FRED: Is it possible
you lost track of time?)

244
00:46:59,352 --> 00:47:02,542
(DAPHNE: What is this about
her having multiple orgasms?)

245
00:47:02,542 --> 00:47:04,283
(FRED: Are you currently hallucinating?)

246
00:47:04,283 --> 00:47:05,186
(SHAGGY: Look guys,

247
00:47:05,211 --> 00:47:09,307
I have a very big dick and can go
for a long time without cuming)

248
00:47:10,328 --> 00:47:12,703
Shit!

249
00:47:16,221 --> 00:47:17,595
Velma, are you okay?

250
00:47:18,471 --> 00:47:20,246
(I'm, I'm fine.)

251
00:47:21,081 --> 00:47:21,988
What was that sound?

252
00:47:22,790 --> 00:47:24,057
(♪)

253
00:47:24,607 --> 00:47:26,107
Sound? What sound?

254
00:47:26,191 --> 00:47:28,954
- Oh shit.
- This is definitely not the right time,

255
00:47:29,067 --> 00:47:31,078
But it never seems to be
the right time.

256
00:47:31,418 --> 00:47:34,695
- You look different naked.
- I bet you do too

257
00:47:37,586 --> 00:47:40,711
Jinkies! You do have a big cock!

258
00:47:41,929 --> 00:47:44,025
I can't believe
I've just said "cock".

259
00:47:44,050 --> 00:47:46,612
I'm gonna make you forget
all about that slut.

260
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:48,543
- Who?
- Exactly.

261
00:48:17,314 --> 00:48:21,039
Oh! I want you to make
sweet love to me.

262
00:49:09,261 --> 00:49:11,277
Jinkies! That's hard!

263
00:50:50,411 --> 00:50:52,729
Oh, I was dreaming about this day.

264
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:56,790
Shaggy,
I'm gonna worship your cock.

265
00:55:04,788 --> 00:55:06,530
I'm not a nerd.
I'm smart.

266
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,636
Shaggy,
it's hotter than in my mouth.

267
00:59:54,947 --> 00:59:56,640
Looks real nice there Velma

268
01:00:01,350 --> 01:00:03,069
Oh Velma, that was amazing.

269
01:00:15,975 --> 01:00:17,227
We got to find the others.

270
01:00:17,379 --> 01:00:18,693
- Yeah.
- I better go get dressed.

271
01:00:18,718 --> 01:00:19,910
Let's go get dressed.

272
01:00:23,005 --> 01:00:24,005
(♪)

273
01:00:26,426 --> 01:00:28,423
Wow, would you look at that!

274
01:00:29,018 --> 01:00:30,702
Is he talking about me or you?

275
01:00:30,891 --> 01:00:32,569
(dubious) I don't know.

276
01:00:32,702 --> 01:00:36,006
- That is huge!
- No, I'm a little creeped out.

277
01:00:36,418 --> 01:00:39,691
- I told you it was big.
- You weren't kidding.

278
01:00:40,228 --> 01:00:41,924
Like, can you not stare?

279
01:00:44,836 --> 01:00:46,911
(suspense sounds)

280
01:00:55,750 --> 01:00:58,350
Whoa... This is ... Whoa!

281
01:01:01,691 --> 01:01:04,075
It must be the stolen money
from all those bank robberies.

282
01:01:04,866 --> 01:01:08,524
Oh my. I think I'm gonna have
another orgasm.

283
01:01:08,732 --> 01:01:09,925
Like, you and me both.

284
01:01:10,746 --> 01:01:11,587
(creaking door)

285
01:01:11,611 --> 01:01:14,254
- Quick, somebody is coming. Hide!
- Zoinks!

286
01:01:16,052 --> 01:01:20,253
Touch it. Put it in my hands,
and rub on it...

287
01:01:23,717 --> 01:01:24,619
Velma!

288
01:01:25,317 --> 01:01:27,061
Hmm, Oh! Daphne!

289
01:01:27,899 --> 01:01:32,550
- Who's your friend?
- Where are the others?

290
01:01:33,394 --> 01:01:36,476
I don't know
what you're talking about.

291
01:01:36,814 --> 01:01:39,137
Sure you do: Fred and Shagg.

292
01:01:39,638 --> 01:01:41,289
Hmm, no,
never heard of them.

293
01:01:41,854 --> 01:01:44,080
Tell me where they are!

294
01:01:44,105 --> 01:01:47,996
Or you both shall perish
from the face of the earth!

295
01:01:48,207 --> 01:01:51,393
Really?
Did you just say "perish"?

296
01:01:51,534 --> 01:01:54,141
Oh my gosh
I've always wanted to go there,

297
01:01:54,342 --> 01:01:56,719
but they don't speak
very good English.

298
01:01:56,744 --> 01:01:58,005
It's hard to understand them.

299
01:01:58,069 --> 01:01:59,792
Silence!

300
01:01:59,817 --> 01:02:04,395
I can sense them in here!
Somewhere ...

301
01:02:05,194 --> 01:02:05,737
*Gulp*

302
01:02:05,887 --> 01:02:08,495
Hey creepy,
what do you think of this?

303
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:09,621
(♪)

304
01:02:09,645 --> 01:02:10,374
*Mmmh*

305
01:02:10,946 --> 01:02:12,679
Is that your tongue?

306
01:02:13,038 --> 01:02:16,861
Quiet, we have to create a distraction so
the boys can jump him.

307
01:02:16,972 --> 01:02:19,248
Just... be quiet and go with it.

308
01:02:19,421 --> 01:02:20,549
Oh! Go with... what?

309
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:48,560
(groans)

310
01:19:50,701 --> 01:19:52,035
(hitting the ground)

311
01:19:52,224 --> 01:19:53,716
(♪) Come on girls, now is our chance!

312
01:19:54,892 --> 01:19:57,051
Wow this feels like a dream.

313
01:19:57,320 --> 01:20:01,354
Hey Fred, I just had sex
with Velma and I liked it.

314
01:20:02,153 --> 01:20:03,782
Get your clothes on, let's go.

315
01:20:04,122 --> 01:20:06,807
Like, we got to go.
Creepo here is about to wake up.

316
01:20:07,630 --> 01:20:09,580
(spooky sounds)

317
01:20:14,555 --> 01:20:16,598
Does anyone else hears
heavy breathing?

318
01:20:22,654 --> 01:20:24,121
(circus music playing)

319
01:21:03,319 --> 01:21:05,594
(strip music playing)

320
01:21:09,969 --> 01:21:11,436
(back to circus music)

321
01:21:36,386 --> 01:21:37,386
(end of music)

322
01:21:38,276 --> 01:21:39,751
(footsteps)

323
01:21:40,067 --> 01:21:42,516
(door closes) 
I think we've lost him.

324
01:21:47,066 --> 01:21:49,825
*Phew*
I really need to stop smoking so much.

325
01:21:50,578 --> 01:21:52,987
Or actually,
I need to stop running so much.

326
01:21:53,462 --> 01:21:57,161
I'm so frustrated:
nothing seems to fit right in.

327
01:21:57,685 --> 01:21:59,828
Well, what you're wearing
seems to be just perfect.

328
01:22:00,561 --> 01:22:01,685
I'd say...

329
01:22:01,743 --> 01:22:05,381
You look mighty sick... very nice.
Very nice.

330
01:22:05,939 --> 01:22:07,592
So, How come you didn't tell me
you like girls?

331
01:22:08,101 --> 01:22:10,564
I don't... I mean, I didn't...

332
01:22:11,268 --> 01:22:13,693
I mean ...
I just found out myself.

333
01:22:14,067 --> 01:22:16,426
And you Velma? Wow...

334
01:22:16,451 --> 01:22:18,461
you really come out
of your shell lately.

335
01:22:18,493 --> 01:22:22,334
Look, I did what I had to.
It was a necessary diversion.

336
01:22:22,928 --> 01:22:25,770
Like diversion,
don't usually come with orgasms.

337
01:22:26,196 --> 01:22:29,832
That's one of the hottest, sexiest
most intense things I've ever seen.

338
01:22:30,258 --> 01:22:33,586
- I'm so corny right now, I could just...
- ...Make a baby?

339
01:22:33,791 --> 01:22:36,303
- Only if you swallow.
- Every drop.

340
01:22:37,744 --> 01:22:41,110
Oh! no, no,
I will not watch this again.

341
01:22:42,275 --> 01:22:44,530
Have I ever told you
how beautiful you are?

342
01:22:44,555 --> 01:22:46,136
What? But I'm just ...

343
01:22:46,220 --> 01:22:49,988
You're sexy, intelligent
and horny as hell.

344
01:22:50,121 --> 01:22:52,813
In my book, that spells "perfect".

345
01:22:53,503 --> 01:22:57,010
Oh jinkie Shaggy,
you're such a romantic.

346
01:22:57,185 --> 01:22:59,889
- I have my moments.
- Oh, that's good too.

347
01:23:02,239 --> 01:23:04,372
(alternative rock music playing)

348
01:45:41,281 --> 01:45:43,375
Shaggy, almost got on my glasses.

349
01:45:44,584 --> 01:45:46,090
Oh... I'm sorry Velma.

350
01:45:56,653 --> 01:45:57,962
Oh my god I'm gonna cum.

351
01:46:00,043 --> 01:46:01,043
Oh Yeah.

352
01:46:23,947 --> 01:46:26,531
Aah...
Have I been a good girl for you?

353
01:46:32,026 --> 01:46:33,835
All this cum all over me.

354
01:46:33,860 --> 01:46:36,834
I'm definitely gonna
get pregnant now huh.

355
01:46:37,782 --> 01:46:40,090
- That's absolutely right.
- Mmhm...

356
01:46:45,799 --> 01:46:48,158
(bedtime story music playing)

357
01:46:50,877 --> 01:46:53,027
Like, why did we wait so long
to do that?

358
01:46:53,394 --> 01:46:54,186
I do not know.

359
01:46:54,211 --> 01:46:57,535
But I have a feeling things are going
to be very different around here.

360
01:46:58,152 --> 01:47:00,611
I don't feel pregnant.
Do I look pregnant?

361
01:47:01,143 --> 01:47:02,231
Apparently not.

362
01:47:03,048 --> 01:47:05,498
*phone chime*

363
01:47:05,548 --> 01:47:06,640
Oh! What's this?

364
01:47:08,839 --> 01:47:10,473
Holy crap, it's Scoob.

365
01:47:11,656 --> 01:47:14,190
Scoob.
Hey buddy, how are you doing?

366
01:47:14,914 --> 01:47:17,390
- Where are you?
(- I'm at Scrappy's place)

367
01:47:17,455 --> 01:47:20,248
- No way, in a crappy place?
(- Scrappy's place!)

368
01:47:20,293 --> 01:47:22,450
What are you doing there?
Oh really?

369
01:47:22,768 --> 01:47:23,842
Are you sure?

370
01:47:24,295 --> 01:47:25,318
Well maybe but ...

371
01:47:26,596 --> 01:47:27,913
All Okay.

372
01:47:28,380 --> 01:47:29,197
Bye.

373
01:47:30,812 --> 01:47:32,198
So, what did he say?

374
01:47:32,455 --> 01:47:33,899
Where is he?
Is he OK?

375
01:47:34,100 --> 01:47:35,926
My vagina hurts.

376
01:47:36,391 --> 01:47:38,571
Well, he said he was at his
nephew Scrappy's place.

377
01:47:39,129 --> 01:47:40,754
And he's just now telling us?

378
01:47:41,253 --> 01:47:45,503
Well, he may have told me before
but I'm a little foggy on that part.

379
01:47:46,183 --> 01:47:47,953
Scrappy kidnapped Scoob?

380
01:47:48,942 --> 01:47:51,133
No, no, no Scoob's fine.

381
01:47:51,315 --> 01:47:53,905
But we are lying here with an
homicidal maniac on the loose.

382
01:47:54,606 --> 01:47:56,795
Well, that sounds bad
if you put it that way.

383
01:47:57,756 --> 01:47:59,382
COPS:
Freeze! Don't move!

384
01:47:59,773 --> 01:48:01,932
- Down on the ground!
CREEPY GOBLIN: Oh!!!

385
01:48:02,009 --> 01:48:04,181
It's a good thing
I called the cops.

386
01:48:04,640 --> 01:48:07,165
(spinning back circus music playing)

387
01:48:15,162 --> 01:48:16,720
Hey, Sergeant Hopkins?

388
01:48:17,729 --> 01:48:19,371
Yeah, it's Daphne.

389
01:48:19,737 --> 01:48:21,445
We're here at Woodburry's house.

390
01:48:21,812 --> 01:48:25,271
Yeah we're getting chased
by some creepy goblin looking guy.

391
01:48:25,613 --> 01:48:27,023
Could you come to save us?

392
01:48:28,214 --> 01:48:29,949
You're the best!
Thanks.

393
01:48:30,465 --> 01:48:32,441
(Come here!) (end of music)

394
01:48:33,711 --> 01:48:34,716
Are you kids okay?

395
01:48:34,994 --> 01:48:36,102
Yes officer,

396
01:48:36,127 --> 01:48:38,693
and I see you've captured
the bad guy.

397
01:48:38,918 --> 01:48:39,893
This is him.

398
01:48:43,324 --> 01:48:44,566
Larry Bans,

399
01:48:44,857 --> 01:48:47,838
better known as
the costume bandit.

400
01:48:48,129 --> 01:48:51,678
Top of the list FBI's most wanted
for bank robberies.

401
01:48:51,908 --> 01:48:53,200
And I'd have gotten
away with it, too,

402
01:48:53,225 --> 01:48:54,992
if it weren't for
those meddling kids!

403
01:48:55,742 --> 01:48:58,557
They are crazy.
They are sex crazy!

404
01:48:59,806 --> 01:49:00,953
Like don't worry, man,

405
01:49:00,978 --> 01:49:03,193
I heard that they're pretty
sex crazy in jail too.

406
01:49:04,223 --> 01:49:05,429
(♪) *Aaargh!*

407
01:49:05,557 --> 01:49:06,895
- Zoiks!
- Get him out of here.

408
01:49:08,257 --> 01:49:10,833
He's the worst of all of them.
(indistinct chatter)

409
01:49:11,853 --> 01:49:13,165
You kids be safe.

410
01:49:13,611 --> 01:49:15,550
You never know
what wandering in the dark.

411
01:49:15,827 --> 01:49:18,597
Oh we know, sir. We know.

412
01:49:20,528 --> 01:49:23,667
Well, another mystery solved,
another caper foiled.

413
01:49:24,334 --> 01:49:26,406
Does this mean that we get
this whole place to ourselves?

414
01:49:27,230 --> 01:49:29,581
We should all take
a great big money bath.

415
01:49:30,764 --> 01:49:33,431
My tummy hurts.
Do you guys think I'm...

416
01:49:33,432 --> 01:49:34,932
NO!

417
01:49:40,100 --> 01:49:42,441
(thunder rumbling and creepy laugh)

418
01:49:44,191 --> 01:49:46,642
(music organ playing)
