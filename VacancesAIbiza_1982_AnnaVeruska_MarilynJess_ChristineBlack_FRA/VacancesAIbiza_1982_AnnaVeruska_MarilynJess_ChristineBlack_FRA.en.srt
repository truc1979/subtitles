00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
- Yes so that the business we are committed can be

Money is available at the cash

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You said you wanted, today, to receive the cash.

Yes, in cash, so that it can do the business we envision.

32
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Make ready money from Mr. Latimère we will take it in a moment

Sign here please

34
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
We were saying that you wanted to have the cash today?

35
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Yes, in cash because it is the only way for us to achieve the business we envision.

36
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I understand, I understand.

37
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Hello, Miss?

38
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Could you prepare money to Mr. Latimère immediatly, please.

39
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
We'll arrive soon, thank you.

40
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
If you want to follow me ...

41
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
- I hope that's enough ...
- It's too much, sir. Thank you!

42
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Tina?

43
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Tina!

44
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Tina! Wake up my dear.

45
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I have a surprise for you.

46
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Tina?

47
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You'll see ... Big surprise.

48
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Oh, John!
What are you doing?

49
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You are crazy!

50
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
What is it?

51
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Honey, that's it, we're rich!

52
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
We are rich!

53
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
But you're certain that the plan is absolutely safe?

54
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I am relatively sure.

55
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It would be the devil if the plan fail.

56
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
And if that happened?

57
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
In this case, we have the A plan.

58
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
We will take off to Rio

59
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
But that cannot happen: I thought about everything.

60
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Honey, you're great.

61
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
This is what I believe from time to time!

62
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
You are truly the greatest of all

63
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
With your skills, it's not a miracle

64
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
If all goes well, we'll be in three months in Rio.

65
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
You stay here, in place, and open your ears

66
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Okay. And you?

67
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I'm leaving now.

68
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Where?

69
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I have to visit an old friend who helped me.

70
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I'll give you news from there

71
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Consul must have a second spring: it's an awesome toy.

72
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Hey hey?

73
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
This must be Isabelle.
My God. Children grow fast.

74
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
They become adults quickly.
She is beautiful.

75
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
A splendid body.

76
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
- My young friend! How are you?
- Fine, Consul

77
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
- You did not get my telegram?
- I did. It just arrived at the office

78
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
So? How was it?

79
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Perfect! Terrific!

80
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Jeanne? Jeanne just see who's there!
It's John!

81
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
John!

82
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
It's good that you come back and see us

83
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
This time you stay with us longer than last time

84
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Because now we have more space, you see there?
Now there's 7 bedrooms

85
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
- And then look this view
- Wow, that's wonderful

86
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
We can see the sea, and there you have the patio ...

87
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
- And then there ...
- Waoo, love!

88
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
- Are you hungry now?
- Yes, a little hungry

89
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
But before, I especially thirsty.

90
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
- Bring us to drink, and especially look after our guest.
- OK sir

91
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
- Cheers
- Cheers

92
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Now, tell me everything

93
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
First, your hand,

94
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
how you want it? In US Dollars? in Deutsche Marks? or in Pesetas?

95
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Especially not in Pesetas.

96
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
If I have the choice, I take it in Dollars.

97
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
OK if you want.

98
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Just look.

99
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
You can count.

100
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Why recount? you know that I trust you

101
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I'm glad to hear that

102
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Trust is a very rare thing

103
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
So? Tell me?

104
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
While listening you will not believe it

105
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
It's a pity you didn't attend the interviews

106
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
You would have seen their faces, it was crazy

107
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
The guys were eager to give me any credit

108
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
No problem.

109
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Of course, the actions were well prepared

110
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
It was a great job. Guys, it was perfect.

111
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
No burrs.

112
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Milan's friends had to give a heck

113
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Because our Toronto man provided impeccable information.

114
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
About the papers, no problem. The 3 men trusted them.

115
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
They haven't noticed any mistake or strange stuff

116
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
so much that they thought it was the deal of their life.

117
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
They practically insist to give me their money.

118
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
That is true. I am not exaggerating.

119
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
What will happen if in two years they want to cash the coupons?

120
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Just before 2 years have passed. Have you think?

121
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
But there is nothing to fear. Nothing could happen.

122
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I told them where I will be that day

123
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
and it would be better that I keep the coupons on me

124
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,000
You're very clever. You thought of everything.

125
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
You'll see life here is great.

126
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
- Now we only have to take advantage of these good things.
- Extra

127
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
- Mister is served
- Ah yes, the meal

128
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
John you should go see Jeanne. I must absent myself.

129
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I have to pass to the office: there is something that I have to put in a safe place

130
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
- I'll be back around 5PM
- See you, Consul

131
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
- Jeanne, the guest stays here, I return around 5PM
- Yes, okay, bye!

132
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Hey, come on! Come!

133
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
- It's been 3 years since we meet last time
- Yes

134
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Three long years that you didn't give us a sign of life

135
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Your husband is also my friend, and my benefactor.

136
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Yes, this is my friend, a generous friend

137
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
and has understanding for everything

138
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
- Do you think he knows?
- Of course he knows!

139
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
You do not need to be afraid.

140
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Come quickly.

141
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Your husband is in great shape, is not it?

142
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
And your relationship? How is he doing?

143
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
What do you want there? We are very happy together.

144
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
And you do not know other men?

145
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:50,000
What do you think? You can not imagine what Carlos can do

146
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
He doesn't mind only about his business

147
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
We shouldn't underestimate him.
You know, he has fire in his veins.

148
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Much better for you

149
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
And it is not just me alone. I'm just a girl among others

150
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
And who are the others?

151
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,000
- Ice, Mrs.
- Thank you, Bella and Blondie

152
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Woohoo ...
Woohoo, girls!

153
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,000
They are not bad

154
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Do you know why we have two maids so sexy?

155
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Consul has a weak point for the staff?

156
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,000
He doesn't like spending money for people he cannot use 24/7

157
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,000
This is why both maids are always at his service, in the kitchen and in bed

158
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,000
- And it doesn't bother you?
- No, it's the opposite

159
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I've listened them lately

160
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I can tell you that Carlos is really an animal

161
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Says, I do not know Carlos in that way

162
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
While there, open your ears,

163
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
this is completely crazy

164
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
He has everything well organized

165
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Ah, my lovely maids

166
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
What do you bring me today?

167
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,000
- Some dildos, as you have asked us
- Magnificent

168
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I like people execute my orders

169
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Yes, we want to serve you our best Mr. Consul

170
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Well, today I'll give you a little bit of reading

171
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
And what will it be?

172
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I would not exactly give you the title because it is very nasty

173
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
On the other hand,

174
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I'd like you to pose different positions which are indicated in these pages

175
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
As you wish, Mr. Consul

176
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Go for it

177
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Wait I have not yet begun

178
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
The title is ... "Touching" ...

179
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Once upon a time, two heedless girls,

180
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
"Heedless" ... because every time ...

181
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
... they went ... to the clearing ...

182
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
... Next to their cottage ...

183
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
... They forgot their panties ...

184
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,000
... And ... preferred to foam slope ...

185
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,000
... Branches of bushes ...

186
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Then one day, they were walking ...

187
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
... Came a leprechaun ...

188
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,000
... A little leprechaun ...

189
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,000
... But with a ...

190
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,000
- I did not know Consul that way ...
- Open your ears again ...

191
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Hey, that's how ... Children become adults and Isabelle become a beautiful girl

192
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
With the temperament of his mother.

193
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
When I see her tender body, I regret that she's my daughter.

194
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Oh you're amazing ... you mean I'm not enough for you?

195
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,000
But of course my little volcano ...

196
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,000
You have at least the temperament of the mother of Isabelle.
And I said "at least"!

197
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,000
From time to time, we can hear Jeanne's temperament throughout the house

198
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Isabelle! Finally! You exaggerate a bit.

199
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Come on, no jealousy scene, stay cool.

200
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,000
- We men, we love it. Isn't it, John?
- Absolutely!

201
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,000
It's great when a woman is sparkling with desire

202
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,000
There's a lot of women who slacken off in Ibiza. Wait a little bit.

203
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Your playboy career is just beginning.

204
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,000
They will fly into your arms. The beautiful wild girls, horny.

205
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
You really think so?

206
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Of course, if you have the time, money, and all the necessary equipment. No huge problem.

207
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,000
About accessories, I have rented a villa for you. That's the key.

208
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Great, thank you!

209
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,000
And lest you miss anything, I entrust the maids. They will take care of you.

210
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Thank you

211
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,000
It's really very nice of Consul of you have entrusted to me

212
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,000
We both have to take care of you

213
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,000
It s really very kind of him. One can say that I'm treated like a sultan!

214
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,000
- It will be a pleasure for us too
- We must read in your eyes all your wishes

215
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,000
- And you can do it?
- Yes

216
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,000
And what you read in my eyes?

217
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,000
You want to fuck!

218
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,000
And what makes you say that?

219
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,000
- I told you they only wanted fuck with us
- I don't care to be fucked,

220
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:29,000
it's part of life, but they shouldn't rob us after

221
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:33,000
They are fucking us, bastards.

222
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Yet my Antonio was really cute

223
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Let us alone with your Italian crush.

224
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
They all are gangsters of the mafia!

225
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Anyway, we are in trouble now ...

226
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,000
We have no more money, no papers,

227
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:55,000
We have nothing. We are really in trouble

228
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Who is he? He's new in Ibiza.

229
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,000
- Hello !
- Hello

230
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,000
You were right: we always meet again in Ibiza

231
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,000
- It's beautiful, isn't it?
- Yes, that's great

232
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,000
We would have needed your help. First the housing problem.

233
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Well, you can come home

234
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Great! Yeah!

235
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,000
It will be nice, you'll see!

236
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,000
- Hello John!
- Hello Isabelle

237
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,000
You found a harem, old playboy!

238
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
These girls are living with me.

239
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,000
You know, their stuff have been stolen and they have no papers

240
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:45,000
I understand: "who needs chicks must have chicks"

241
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
it never hurt anyone

242
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
That's Tony, my boyfriend

243
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,000
We wanted to have a tour on the sea with Tony's boat, unfortunately it's down

244
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Hey, it's something to do!

245
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:01,000
- Would you like to have a boat ride?
- Great!

246
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,000
- Isabelle, what do you think? We buy a boat?
- Yeah, great!

247
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,000
This one, it's not bad.

248
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Hello captain. It's a nice boat you got there.

249
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,000
That's what I think too.

250
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
And a boat like that, how much does it cost?

251
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,000
What are you saying? A boat? No, it's a ship, sir.

252
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,000
It was very expensive.

253
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:47,000
- How much?
- Half a million.

254
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:51,000
- Half a million pesetas?
- No, half a million Dollars, of course!

255
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
My friends, you hear that? Half a million Dollars

256
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
That's peanuts for me

257
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Are you kidding?

258
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,000
I pay you with cash. 600,000, without receipts. OK?

259
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,000
And where do you take these 600,000 Dollars?

260
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,000
it is my business, Captain. Do you agree or not?

261
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Ok, I leave it to you.

262
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,000
here it is, captain. 600,000. From hand to hand.

263
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,000
and without a receipt.

264
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,000
- Hey, your Tony, he's having a good time with one ...
- And why not?

265
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,000
- While you are here, on the same boat
- And after?

266
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:03,000
- It makes good points for me too
- Can you explain what that means?

267
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,000
I'll show you right away

268
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,000
All sailors to the captain!

269
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Come on, I'll make a splash

270
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Captain, Bravo!

271
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:58,000
- Hi girls!
- Isabelle Hey!

272
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:04,000
- It's okay?
- It's okay

273
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:08,000
John, do you remind there's a party tonight? The one dad prepared in your honor

274
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Yes naturally. All the girls are already preparing

275
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Good. I thought you wanted to stay with your whole harem

276
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Don't tell bad things. Why do you think things like that?

277
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Come on, you'd rather stay with us.

278
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Better not. I won't bother you any longer, I'll do a motorcycle ride

279
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:31,000
At least, I am sure to be the only one with that. Ciao.

280
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:35,000
This Isabelle is very jealous. She seems to be in love with you

281
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:39,000
but you belong to us

282
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,000
They are not afraid to press the throttle.
I wish I could do the same.

283
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,000
You have to be more experienced.

284
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:07,000
It's hard enough for a man, so for you ...

285
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:11,000
- Are you planning to ride there? You?
- Well what? We'll see

286
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:15,000
- You are going to fall
- You bet I won't?

287
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:19,000
- You don't realize how it is!
- I do!

288
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:23,000
- And don't cry if you get hurt
- If you can do it, then I can do it too

289
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:33,000
- You think you know riding motorcycles?
- Yes. Yes

290
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,000
You'd better leave, Cycling beginners band

291
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Because if you want to show the girls, you have to get up early

292
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:50,000
What you need, it's Them.

293
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:56,000
You'll have to throttle

294
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:51,000
- Wait, I'm coming
- I hold her

295
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:58,000
- Come and help me
- I'm coming

296
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Lay her on this

297
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:17,000
- Her little motorcycle outfit...
- this gonna be tasty

298
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Second, third, and I retrograde.

299
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:32,000
So you wanted to have emotions? You're gonna have them

300
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:10,000
You think a little about his buddy? My turn!

301
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Small cock become big

302
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:23,000
You imagine? They jumped on me!

303
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:27,000
- I still have my legs trembling
- Real men with leather jacket?

304
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,000
- Yes, I think they all had leather jackets.

305
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:34,000
I believe they also have leather cock

306
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:39,000
I invited them. If you want, you can try

307
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Do not worry, I'll hit one. These guys, I know how to deal with

308
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,000
- To our millions!
- To our millions!

309
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:56,000
But I have nothing more to drink ... Please?

310
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:04,000
It's party!
