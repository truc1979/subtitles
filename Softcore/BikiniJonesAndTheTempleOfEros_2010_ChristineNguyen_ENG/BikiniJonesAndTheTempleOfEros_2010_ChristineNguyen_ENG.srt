2
00:02:28,751 --> 00:02:29,642
This is Martin.

3
00:02:29,642 --> 00:02:33,031
This is Dr Jones. I'm in Cruella
Industries Headquarters.

4
00:02:33,483 --> 00:02:35,603
Excellent. Any trouble?

5
00:02:35,603 --> 00:02:36,725
(Not yet.)

6
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:39,757
But I have cleaned 3 floors with
the toilets to get here.

7
00:02:41,289 --> 00:02:44,025
Excellent work Dr Jones. Your
country appreciates it.

8
00:02:44,343 --> 00:02:45,634
Any sign of the idol?

9
00:02:46,357 --> 00:02:47,997
That's right in front of me.

10
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,777
Can you secure it?

11
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:52,323
Its value is a *** national security.

12
00:02:52,915 --> 00:02:54,371
Looks easy enough.

13
00:02:54,857 --> 00:02:56,239
That's what worries me.

14
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,369
Is our deal still on place?

15
00:02:58,969 --> 00:03:02,039
Yes, you will be allowed to study it
for your own research,

16
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:04,592
as long as we know it's not in
the hands of our enemies.

17
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:08,439
No one want the CIA going back
on their word now.

18
00:03:08,908 --> 00:03:10,581
No tricks, Jones.

19
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,719
Just get the idol away from Evilla Cruella,

20
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:16,473
and you've done the world greatest service.

21
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,284
It doesn't seem to be an
alarm system in place.

22
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,326
I'll call you once I'm outside.

23
00:03:22,326 --> 00:03:24,109
Be careful.

24
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,800
Don't worry,

25
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,011
I've stolen my fair share of idols.

26
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:29,968
Piece of cake.

27
00:03:29,968 --> 00:03:31,218
Over and out.

28
00:03:44,454 --> 00:03:45,401
Hmm.

29
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:50,665
You will look spectacular in my trophy case.

30
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,367
Freeze!

31
00:03:52,727 --> 00:03:54,521
(Put your hands up.)

32
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,757
Easy Lady.

33
00:03:58,903 --> 00:04:00,143
What are you doing in here?

34
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,157
Let me guess...

35
00:04:02,157 --> 00:04:03,604
Silent alarm?

36
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:04,693
That's right.

37
00:04:04,693 --> 00:04:06,406
Now I've asked you: what were you doing?

38
00:04:06,951 --> 00:04:08,552
What's it look like, Einstein?

39
00:04:08,552 --> 00:04:10,191
I'm the cleaning lady.

40
00:04:10,191 --> 00:04:11,263
(I'm cleaning up.)

41
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,123
How'd you get in here?

42
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,416
All the doors are locked.

43
00:04:15,162 --> 00:04:17,435
Can I help it?
I get paid to clean.

44
00:04:17,435 --> 00:04:20,425
I finished three floors,
this was my last stop.

45
00:04:21,373 --> 00:04:22,360
That's right.

46
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,573
I saw you on the second floor.

47
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You do good work.

48
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,750
Thanks. I try.

49
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,628
(Well, I guess there's no harm done.)

50
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,146
We better not let anybody know about this.

51
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,950
They'll fire one of us for sure.

52
00:04:35,843 --> 00:04:37,150
Why would I tell anyone?

53
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:38,518
I don't want to lose my job.

54
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:39,450
(Well, me either.)

55
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,350
So we agree? This never happened.

56
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:43,929
What happened?

57
00:04:44,413 --> 00:04:46,269
Yeah, that's the idea.

58
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:49,036
You know, my shift is over now.

59
00:04:49,403 --> 00:04:50,384
What do you say?

60
00:04:50,853 --> 00:04:52,347
(You and me seal the deal?)

61
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:55,975
This way neither one of us
is tempted to talk about it later.

62
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,059
You mean...

63
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,381
...you and me?

64
00:05:01,124 --> 00:05:03,097
Right here on the desk.

65
00:05:04,203 --> 00:05:05,576
Well...

66
00:05:06,338 --> 00:05:08,966
I guess no one gonna miss me
for a little while.

67
00:05:09,781 --> 00:05:10,878
Great.

68
00:05:10,878 --> 00:05:12,588
Let's not waste any time.

69
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,517
Oh baby, you already
started to me good luck.

70
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:40,030
(And that, Mr Martin,)

71
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:43,555
it's how I stole the sacred idol of Eros
right from under their noses.

72
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,644
Excellent work, Dr Jones. Excellent.

73
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,998
You know, word on the street is that Evilla Cruella

74
00:10:49,998 --> 00:10:52,845
is absolutely having a cow over this.

75
00:10:53,628 --> 00:10:55,096
And well, she might.

76
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:57,965
We have to ensure that this never
falls into her hands again.

77
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,588
Don't forget our deal:

78
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,676
I keep the idol for my research,
and when I'm done,

79
00:11:02,676 --> 00:11:05,580
you CIA boys can have it for your
little collection.

80
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,335
I wish you'd reconsider
our agreement Dr Jones.

81
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:11,413
We can't afford to have that
floating around out there somewhere.

82
00:11:12,235 --> 00:11:14,154
It won't be floating anywhere.

83
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,740
It will be with me.

84
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,502
I'll take good care of it.

85
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,994
You realize that on that idol, somewhere,

86
00:11:21,994 --> 00:11:24,265
is the location of the temple of Eros?

87
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:25,456
Exactly.

88
00:11:25,456 --> 00:11:29,203
And whoever finds the temple, finds
the Tiara of Aisha.

89
00:11:29,496 --> 00:11:30,700
Exactly.

90
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,541
And whoever has the Tiara of Aisha,

91
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:36,959
shall be the ruler of the Empire of Moronica.

92
00:11:38,405 --> 00:11:41,963
Can you believe Evilla Cruella,
with all her millions,

93
00:11:41,963 --> 00:11:44,034
still wants to be ruler of the Empire?

94
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,948
(That's not gonna happen.)

95
00:11:46,232 --> 00:11:47,395
We're counting on you.

96
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,850
(Listen Martin,)

97
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:52,105
I'll give you this trinket as soon as
I decipher the map to the temple.

98
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,893
That's all I'm interested in.

99
00:11:53,893 --> 00:11:56,563
And what then? You'll hold on to the Tiara?

100
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,775
It's a museum piece.

101
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:03,095
I have no intention of becoming
queen of the morons.

102
00:12:03,444 --> 00:12:05,035
That's your job.

103
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,186
Contact me the moment you break the code.

104
00:12:09,686 --> 00:12:10,916
Ciao baby.

105
00:12:18,903 --> 00:12:22,903
I want that idol. It's mine
by right of my ancestry.

106
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,125
Perhaps. But I thought you were from Hoboken.

107
00:12:26,675 --> 00:12:29,367
Hoboken... Well...

108
00:12:29,367 --> 00:12:34,836
My grandpa did settled there, but my
real destiny is the Empire of Moronica.

109
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,562
Yes, of course.

110
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,947
This is all very unfortunate.

111
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,714
I entrusted my spies to bring me my idol.

112
00:12:42,714 --> 00:12:45,197
We had it, but it slipped away.

113
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:46,681
(And I want it back.)

114
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:49,369
How can we help you achieve
your goals, Mistress?

115
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:53,773
I must have that idol. It alone has the
location of the temple of Eros.

116
00:12:54,138 --> 00:12:57,200
With it i can acquire the Tiara of Aisha,

117
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,382
and rule all of Moronica.

118
00:12:59,837 --> 00:13:02,651
And then you will be the supreme
Empress of Moronica.

119
00:13:03,081 --> 00:13:04,656
Suits me well, don't you think?

120
00:13:04,656 --> 00:13:06,100
It does, indeed.

121
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:07,841
Then get me that idol.

122
00:13:07,841 --> 00:13:10,577
I don't care how you do it
or by what means,

123
00:13:10,577 --> 00:13:13,000
just bring it back to me.

124
00:13:13,332 --> 00:13:16,186
I understand that Dr Jones,
the eminent archaeologist,

125
00:13:16,186 --> 00:13:17,486
(has it in her possession.)

126
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,598
Then you know what to do.

127
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:23,539
Rally our spies in America
and bring me that idol.

128
00:13:23,944 --> 00:13:24,885
At your command.

129
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,699
I will have that idol ***.

130
00:13:49,549 --> 00:13:52,580
Man! I feel like I haven't
showered in a week.

131
00:13:53,584 --> 00:13:58,532
At least, still smells like
a blonde security guard.

132
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:00,689
Well, I can fix that.

133
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:06,769
Who the hell are you?

134
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,399
(Carol Summers.)

135
00:17:08,399 --> 00:17:10,850
Department of National Antiquities.

136
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:17,359
Martin asked me to stop by to see
if I could be of any assistance.

137
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,026
Is that so...

138
00:17:19,736 --> 00:17:21,742
(Well, I didn't hear anything about this,)

139
00:17:21,742 --> 00:17:24,276
and I don't remember asking for any help.

140
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,500
Well, Martin's anxious to have
the idol in safekeeping.

141
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:29,100
As long as you possess it,

142
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,600
(it it could fall into the wrong hands.)

143
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,802
Pff, yeah, I've heard the spiel.

144
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,149
Can you give me a moment?

145
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,348
Alright.

146
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,994
You can just step outside to the hallway.

147
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,557
[*phone rings*]

148
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:53,546
Martin here.

149
00:17:53,766 --> 00:17:55,100
This is Dr Jones.

150
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:56,735
Ah. Doctor.

151
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,613
Everything's all right?

152
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:00,912
Just calling to check on a Carol Summers.

153
00:18:01,479 --> 00:18:02,423
Yes?

154
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,904
One of yours?

155
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,800
(Absolutely. We thought
you might need a hand.)

156
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,350
Carol is an excellent... cipher.

157
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,006
So am I.

158
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,050
But I could use some help.

159
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,950
Might speed up the process a little.

160
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,376
That's what we thought.

161
00:18:18,376 --> 00:18:19,755
She's very good.

162
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,447
I'm sure you two will hit it all off.

163
00:18:22,761 --> 00:18:23,663
I'll let you know.

164
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,025
Hey, and next time you ask
someone to drop in on me,

165
00:18:27,025 --> 00:18:28,501
warn me first.

166
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,411
Understood.

167
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,217
Carol?

168
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,700
Everything hunky-dory?

169
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,150
Yeah, it's all "hunky-dory".

170
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,500
So what's your game, sister?

171
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,392
I'm just your average, red blooded,
all american egghead, I guess.

172
00:18:50,605 --> 00:18:52,160
Too smart for my own good.

173
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,252
No luck with the boys, huh?

174
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:58,000
No. Guys don't make passes
at girls who wear glasses.

175
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,350
That's why I wear contacts.

176
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,754
I wish I could but it hurts my eyes.

177
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:06,588
Hmm, studying too hard.
You should get out more.

178
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,217
Hmm, maybe.

179
00:19:08,217 --> 00:19:09,788
Everything's okay?

180
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,063
Oh...

181
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,995
That's a whip mark.

182
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,125
A whip mark?

183
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,300
Got it in Istanbul.

184
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:17,950
That's incredible.

185
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,555
Someone actually whipped you?

186
00:19:19,978 --> 00:19:22,859
Well, they tried. But they didn't
get away with it.

187
00:19:22,977 --> 00:19:25,515
I had a live cobra in my pants.

188
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,134
A live cobra?

189
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,930
(Never underestimate the power of...)

190
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:31,868
highly poisonous and very pissed-off snake.

191
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,900
Sounds like you've been through a lot.

192
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,116
And I've got the bruises to prove it.

193
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,340
A person who lives a dangerous
life like you do,

194
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:41,536
needs to relax more.

195
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,233
Maybe.

196
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:46,204
But in my line of work you
got to keep on your toes.

197
00:19:46,724 --> 00:19:49,033
Sounds like you need a massage.

198
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,318
I studied Rikki in college.

199
00:19:52,515 --> 00:19:53,394
Rikki?

200
00:19:53,394 --> 00:19:58,196
Rikki Tikki Tavi. The art of
sensuous mongoose massage.

201
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:00,150
Are you any good?

202
00:20:00,656 --> 00:20:02,850
Well... I haven't had any luck with the boys,

203
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:05,100
but I scored a pretty high with the girls.

204
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:05,717
Mm-hmm.

205
00:20:06,593 --> 00:20:08,239
Well...

206
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:11,974
Martin did say you were
to lend a helping hand.

207
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:15,365
He didn't say where those hands
would be used.

208
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,362
So what the hell?

209
00:25:41,149 --> 00:25:42,988
At last...

210
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,876
"The person who possesses it rules the Empire".

211
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:49,565
Dought... Who wants it?

212
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:55,368
This was too easy.

213
00:25:57,850 --> 00:25:58,927
Hold it!

214
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,548
Okay, okay, don't shoot.

215
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:04,357
Now, gently. Put everything back on the counter.

216
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,471
(That's a good boy.)

217
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,667
Now tell me: who do you work for?

218
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:11,650
I think you already know.

219
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,878
I work for the rightful owner of that idol:

220
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,366
Evilla Cruella. The heir to the Empire Moronica.

221
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,397
You mean: "the airhead".

222
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:22,008
Wait. Isn't she from Hoboken?

223
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:25,574
Well, her grandpa settled in Hoboken
but her ancestors were Morons.

224
00:26:25,574 --> 00:26:27,085
Make no mistake about it.

225
00:26:27,964 --> 00:26:29,836
I'm gonna have to trust you on that one.

226
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,911
Unfortunately the idol is mine now,

227
00:26:32,911 --> 00:26:37,260
and when I finish, the CIA is gonna
put it where the sun don't shine.

228
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,712
You don't know what you're
playing with, Dr Jones.

229
00:26:39,712 --> 00:26:42,150
Evilla will go to great lengths
to regain that idol.

230
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,329
You could be a very rich woman.

231
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:46,600
What's money to me?

232
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:50,200
You could have power. Lots of power.

233
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,326
I'm already telling the
CIA where to stick it.

234
00:26:52,326 --> 00:26:53,878
How much more power do I need?

235
00:26:54,539 --> 00:26:57,488
Hmm. You could have rocking
sex, day and night.

236
00:26:57,719 --> 00:26:58,474
Nice...

237
00:26:58,550 --> 00:26:59,993
But I'm a little tired.

238
00:27:00,074 --> 00:27:02,553
Now turn around, and put your
hands behind your back.

239
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,638
(Okay.)

240
00:27:04,676 --> 00:27:07,220
But this is gonna hurt you a
lot more than it hurts me.

241
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,797
(That's what all the boys say.)

242
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:10,618
*Ouch*

243
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,694
Good work, Carol.

244
00:27:15,482 --> 00:27:17,500
I thought you might sleep through
the entire thing.

245
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,872
Dr Jones takes a lot out of a woman.

246
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:21,785
I'm still a little weak in the knees.

247
00:27:21,785 --> 00:27:22,934
(Cool your jets, Carol!)

248
00:27:23,134 --> 00:27:25,507
Let's grab everything and get out
of here before she wakes up.

249
00:27:26,003 --> 00:27:29,965
See you doctor. Thanks for the hot sex.

250
00:27:33,709 --> 00:27:36,400
This is terrible news, Dr Jones.

251
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,643
Yes.

252
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,562
... I mean... What is?

253
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:42,350
Are you sure you're alright?

254
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:43,600
Me?

255
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,377
Pff. Of course I am.

256
00:27:47,405 --> 00:27:48,657
What did you just called me?

257
00:27:49,395 --> 00:27:51,951
You're Dr Jones.

258
00:27:52,648 --> 00:27:53,660
I am?

259
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,977
Oh dear...

260
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,500
Don't you remember anything that's happened?

261
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:00,690
Oh! Of course I do.

262
00:28:00,862 --> 00:28:02,156
I took a shower,

263
00:28:02,156 --> 00:28:04,604
(got to know Carol a little better,)

264
00:28:04,604 --> 00:28:06,888
and then I found this strange guy in my house.

265
00:28:06,888 --> 00:28:08,250
And he was stealing the idol.

266
00:28:08,258 --> 00:28:09,258
Yes, yes?

267
00:28:09,557 --> 00:28:11,379
I had the upper hand...

268
00:28:11,913 --> 00:28:15,873
and the he told me that Evilla Cruella
wants to be Empress of Moronica.

269
00:28:17,509 --> 00:28:19,803
She comes from a long line of Morons.

270
00:28:19,877 --> 00:28:22,088
From Hoboken... so I'm told.

271
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,071
Yeah, that's what I thought too.

272
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:25,410
But the bottom line is:

273
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:29,316
"Whoever finds the Tiara of Aisha,
can crown themselves Empress"

274
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,513
(It's a slam dunk)

275
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,500
Anyone can be ruler. Even you.

276
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:34,893
Yep.

277
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,250
What about Carol?

278
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,290
Gone when I woke up.

279
00:28:39,096 --> 00:28:40,230
Maybe she split...

280
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,718
Maybe she got kidnapped!

281
00:28:43,332 --> 00:28:44,746
(You haven't heard from her?)

282
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,200
Nothing.

283
00:28:46,702 --> 00:28:49,702
Now you understand it's vitally
important that we recover this idol.

284
00:28:52,328 --> 00:28:54,231
It's your personal responsibility.

285
00:28:54,231 --> 00:28:57,271
This never would have happened had you
taken my advice in the first place.

286
00:28:57,271 --> 00:28:58,963
Save your speeches.

287
00:28:58,963 --> 00:29:00,059
I feel bad enough.

288
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,550
Don't worry.

289
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,147
How can I not worry?

290
00:29:05,032 --> 00:29:07,052
I've got a secret.

291
00:29:07,594 --> 00:29:09,331
Tell me! Tell me!

292
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:13,400
I placed a small tracking
device on the idol base.

293
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,567
I've got a GPS signal onto every move.

294
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,644
Excellent Dr Jones.

295
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,150
Where is the idol now?

296
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,800
I don't know.

297
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,619
The tracking unit's broken
BUT I'm working on it.

298
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:33,061
I'll send a tech over to help out.

299
00:29:33,433 --> 00:29:36,345
(In the meantime, please, keep in touch.)

300
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,444
Ask him to knock next time, okay?

301
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,437
[*phone rings*]

302
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,929
Martin here.

303
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,550
[*phone rings*]

304
00:34:32,517 --> 00:34:33,506
Mr Martin?

305
00:34:33,506 --> 00:34:36,302
Sorry, I was away from my phone.

306
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:39,850
Yeah.

307
00:34:40,068 --> 00:34:41,555
Let me stop by my house,

308
00:34:41,555 --> 00:34:43,405
I'll change, get my tools,

309
00:34:43,405 --> 00:34:46,405
and I *** over there.

310
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,077
Okay.

311
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:54,570
You have news for me?

312
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,600
The best.

313
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:59,543
Excellent.

314
00:34:59,711 --> 00:35:02,364
Finally a man who does not disappoint.

315
00:35:03,246 --> 00:35:04,674
I've got the notebook.

316
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:08,468
Good Carol. Your training has paid off.

317
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,635
These pages are blank.

318
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:20,238
We didn't have a chance to
start unscrambling the code.

319
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:24,100
This is worthless.

320
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:25,900
What now mistress?

321
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:33,688
Carol, I want you to go back to Dr Jones.

322
00:35:33,688 --> 00:35:36,192
Tell her you were kidnapped
but managed to escape.

323
00:35:36,192 --> 00:35:38,974
Then I want you to gain her confidence,

324
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:41,052
and see what you can find out.

325
00:35:41,773 --> 00:35:43,465
Yes mistress.

326
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,186
You've done well, Drago.

327
00:35:54,186 --> 00:35:57,730
You deserve a reward, and I alone
will give it to you.

328
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,450
I am unworthy, but I will take it.

329
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:02,072
Come with me.

330
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,529
Such a good, good boy.

331
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:41,195
Take this tight pants off of here.

332
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:43,979
Damnit.

333
00:41:43,979 --> 00:41:46,965
Close, but not good enough to get me a signal.

334
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:56,337
Carol!

335
00:41:56,661 --> 00:41:57,683
Dr Jones.

336
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,045
What happened to you?

337
00:41:59,138 --> 00:42:00,826
(After you were knocked on the head,)

338
00:42:00,826 --> 00:42:03,573
two men grabbed me from
the bed and kidnapped me.

339
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,846
Poor thing.

340
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:07,806
It was terrible. Just terrible.

341
00:42:07,806 --> 00:42:09,332
They thought I knew something,

342
00:42:09,332 --> 00:42:11,995
so they brought me to this
abandoned warehouse,

343
00:42:11,995 --> 00:42:14,474
where they did awful things to me.

344
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:17,488
But I couldn't tell them anything
cuz I didn't know anything.

345
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:18,200
You know?

346
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,197
I know.

347
00:42:20,344 --> 00:42:21,519
Did they hurt you?

348
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:24,097
I'm okay. Just scared I guess.

349
00:42:24,097 --> 00:42:27,497
When they realized I couldn't help them,
they left me there.

350
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:30,187
I managed to wiggle myself loose,

351
00:42:30,187 --> 00:42:32,576
and rush over here to see if you were okay.

352
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:38,432
Carol... You're wearing different clothes.

353
00:42:38,432 --> 00:42:40,907
Well... I went home first...

354
00:42:40,907 --> 00:42:43,381
cuz they kidnapped me while
I was naked after all.

355
00:42:44,096 --> 00:42:44,856
Of course.

356
00:42:45,438 --> 00:42:47,348
Oh well, I'm glad you're okay.

357
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,471
What are you doing?

358
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:54,098
I managed to put a tracking device in
the base of the idol.

359
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:56,312
Really?

360
00:42:56,312 --> 00:42:57,876
I didn't know that.

361
00:42:58,100 --> 00:42:59,217
Well I did.

362
00:42:59,217 --> 00:43:01,034
But my tracking device is on the blank,

363
00:43:01,034 --> 00:43:02,891
and I can't seem to get it to work.

364
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:04,450
Can you fix it?

365
00:43:04,747 --> 00:43:07,361
Maybe. I'm working on it.

366
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:09,984
Is there anything you can't do?

367
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,098
I can't give myself head...

368
00:43:13,149 --> 00:43:14,649
...but I'm working on that too.

369
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:16,079
Really?

370
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:19,130
No, that was a joke.

371
00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:19,986
Oh.

372
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:21,000
[*someone's knocking at the door*]

373
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,575
Do me a favor, go see who that is.

374
00:43:23,575 --> 00:43:24,471
Okay.

375
00:43:37,136 --> 00:43:38,764
Look what I found.

376
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:44,097
Mark X.

377
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,036
(Let me guess: you're here to help.)

378
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,652
You don't look happy to see me.

379
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:49,941
I don't have time for your CIA boy toy games.

380
00:43:49,941 --> 00:43:51,399
I've got a lot of work to do here.

381
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:52,510
That's why I'm here.

382
00:43:52,650 --> 00:43:54,937
Martin thought that I can work
the bugs out of your tracking device.

383
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:56,949
Knock yourself out.

384
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:00,650
What seems to be the trouble?

385
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:02,235
It's not working.

386
00:44:03,895 --> 00:44:05,196
I got that much.

387
00:44:05,196 --> 00:44:07,514
Did you... drop it, or...

388
00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:10,338
Well, yeah.
From about 50 feet up in the air.

389
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:11,993
That sounds pretty reckless.

390
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:14,062
Even from you.

391
00:44:14,855 --> 00:44:16,936
Well, when you're hanging by a toenail,

392
00:44:16,936 --> 00:44:19,730
butt-naked from a Portuguese hot-air
balloon over Libya,

393
00:44:19,730 --> 00:44:21,844
your set of priorities tends to change a bit.

394
00:44:22,157 --> 00:44:23,322
I guess so.

395
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,097
Nice view though, huh?

396
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:26,949
No one complained.

397
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,641
Yeah... Do you mind?

398
00:44:29,185 --> 00:44:30,147
(Go ahead.)

399
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:32,428
(I've got to take off for about an hour.)

400
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:34,912
Carol here will keep you company.

401
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:36,106
Where are you going?

402
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:39,818
Martin set me up with a certain Dr Xavier...

403
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,400
Seems I'm still a bit foggy up here.

404
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:44,788
Hopefully I'll have it up and
running by the time you get back.

405
00:44:44,819 --> 00:44:45,713
Good luck.

406
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:51,020
Now... Let's see if we can fix this baby.

407
00:44:59,755 --> 00:45:02,592
Why these places always have to be freezing.

408
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:06,996
Then they give you these stupid
gowns with your butt hanging out.

409
00:45:06,851 --> 00:45:09,029
Pff. Honestly...

410
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:15,745
So you're Dr Jones.

411
00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:19,442
Uh... Doctor of ancient relics and archaeology.

412
00:45:19,442 --> 00:45:20,815
Not a medical doctor.

413
00:45:20,815 --> 00:45:21,694
I'm relieved.

414
00:45:21,877 --> 00:45:24,200
For a moment I thought you
were trying to treat yourself.

415
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:26,800
I'm Dr Xavier.

416
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:29,964
Dr X? I like that.

417
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:32,928
So what seems to be the trouble?

418
00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:36,232
Well this sounds crazy,

419
00:45:36,232 --> 00:45:38,505
but I had this guy at gunpoint,

420
00:45:38,505 --> 00:45:43,063
oh, real numbskull, you know,
IQ hovering around room temperature.

421
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:47,556
I think I know the type.

422
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:48,587
Well...

423
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:52,195
I've got the drop on this goon and I was
I was about to handcuff his ass,

424
00:45:52,195 --> 00:45:53,880
when someone hit me from behind.

425
00:45:54,122 --> 00:45:55,185
And then, when I woke up,

426
00:45:55,185 --> 00:45:56,753
I had a touch of...

427
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,521
Amnesia?

428
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,546
I can't remember.

429
00:46:01,942 --> 00:46:02,643
Hmmm...

430
00:46:03,295 --> 00:46:04,197
Yeah...

431
00:46:06,957 --> 00:46:08,363
Take one of these.

432
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:09,767
This will help.

433
00:46:11,122 --> 00:46:13,203
This will help me remember?

434
00:46:13,754 --> 00:46:15,250
Not exactly.

435
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:17,515
But it'll make the exam go by a lot easier.

436
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:21,878
Okay. I'm down for easy.

437
00:46:22,355 --> 00:46:23,304
Now what?

438
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:24,749
Give it a moment.

439
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:29,456
Oh....

440
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:31,685
(Wooo...)

441
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,735
It really... gives a kick.

442
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:36,692
Oh...

443
00:46:39,050 --> 00:46:41,588
I feel a mile high right now!

444
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,156
Good.

445
00:46:43,607 --> 00:46:45,481
Cuz we're gonna go on a little trip.

446
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:49,037
I'm tripping right now, Doctor.

447
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:51,290
Come on, how about some free love, huh?

448
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,429
1960 style, yeah.

449
00:46:55,037 --> 00:46:58,502
Well... We have a few hours
until the plane leaves...

450
00:46:58,502 --> 00:47:00,823
I guess we can start the exam right now.

451
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:02,584
Doctor,

452
00:47:02,814 --> 00:47:05,765
I want you to start from top... to bottom.

453
00:47:05,850 --> 00:47:07,950
And don't leave anything out.

454
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:10,511
Oh. I won't.

455
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:14,665
(Come on... Damnit...)

456
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:16,919
Work your little son of a bitch.

457
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:18,292
Still no luck?

458
00:52:19,196 --> 00:52:21,490
It should be working, but it's not.

459
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:23,227
Too bad.

460
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,723
Hey wait a minute... I see something.

461
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:31,597
I might have found the problem.

462
00:52:32,132 --> 00:52:33,056
What is it?

463
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:38,905
I think I got the bugs out.

464
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:41,700
[*beep*]

465
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:42,257
Yeah!

466
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:43,922
It's working!

467
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:46,191
Can it locate the idol?

468
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:49,537
It's searching.

469
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:50,225
it's gonna take a little while for
the gather of the satellite info,

470
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:52,160
and provide us a map.

471
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:53,642
So now what?

472
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:57,030
Now we get this over to CIA headquarters,

473
00:52:57,192 --> 00:52:59,046
(and then Martin and the boys get on it.)

474
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:00,071
Stop.

475
00:53:00,071 --> 00:53:01,932
Shouldn't we wait for Dr Jones?

476
00:53:01,932 --> 00:53:03,249
It is her device.

477
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:07,646
Yeah, maybe, but I hate waiting.

478
00:53:09,014 --> 00:53:10,252
I better call Martin.

479
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:17,253
[*phone rings*]

480
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:19,277
Martin here.

481
00:53:19,276 --> 00:53:20,254
It's Mark.

482
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:21,630
I got the GPS working.

483
00:53:21,950 --> 00:53:22,825
Great news.

484
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,300
Can you locate the idol?

485
00:53:24,437 --> 00:53:27,109
Not clear yet,
but I think it's on its way to Moronica.

486
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:30,050
Just what we suspected.

487
00:53:30,050 --> 00:53:33,812
As soon as Dr Jones returns,
I'll be on my way.

488
00:53:34,696 --> 00:53:36,747
One more thing:

489
00:53:37,193 --> 00:53:40,889
[*One cannot hear what Martin says*]

490
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:42,007
Copy that.

491
00:53:42,486 --> 00:53:43,597
I'll handle it.

492
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:45,937
What'd he say?

493
00:53:46,048 --> 00:53:47,486
He says:

494
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:49,100
We wait.

495
00:53:50,044 --> 00:53:53,516
Well... Maybe I can help the
time go quicker.

496
00:53:57,223 --> 00:53:59,838
Well I have been under a
little stress lately...

497
00:59:52,524 --> 00:59:55,108
MORONICA

498
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:05,034
Keep moving Dr Jones,
just a few more miles.

499
01:00:05,375 --> 01:00:06,329
Bastard!

500
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,703
You know you're not gonna
get away with this.

501
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:10,629
I already have.

502
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:13,090
Besides, you always wanted to see
the temple of Eros,

503
01:00:13,090 --> 01:00:15,257
now you can. Up-close.

504
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:16,100
Move it.

505
01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:17,755
Quit jerking my chain!

506
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:19,115
Dude.

507
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:23,472
Mr Martin did have a message for you.

508
01:00:23,472 --> 01:00:24,998
I almost forgot to tell you.

509
01:00:25,050 --> 01:00:26,034
What was it about?

510
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:28,603
Hum...

511
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:32,359
He said they found the "real" Carol Summers.

512
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:34,700
Tied up in a warehouse in Hoboken.

513
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:36,150
***

514
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:37,486
(You were pretty clever.)

515
01:00:37,486 --> 01:00:40,948
and your ploy to keep me here
worked beautifully.

516
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:43,401
Dr Jones isn't coming back, is she?

517
01:00:43,401 --> 01:00:44,752
No, she's not.

518
01:00:44,752 --> 01:00:47,033
She's probably halfway around
the world by now.

519
01:00:49,071 --> 01:00:50,215
Well...

520
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:52,950
Then I'll use this to find her,

521
01:00:53,391 --> 01:00:55,100
and effect a rescue.

522
01:00:55,950 --> 01:00:56,921
What about me?

523
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:00,316
Oh I'll call Martin. Tell them
where they can pick you up.

524
01:01:01,050 --> 01:01:02,300
It's been real, baby.

525
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:04,479
You bastard!

526
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:08,545
Almost there.

527
01:01:10,050 --> 01:01:13,017
Somehow, it looked a lot more
exotic in the brochure.

528
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:14,443
That's not the ***, Doctor.

529
01:01:14,443 --> 01:01:16,646
That is where we'll meet Mrs Evilla.

530
01:01:16,797 --> 01:01:17,254
Pff.

531
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:18,962
Not exactly a palace.

532
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:20,500
Shut up and move.

533
01:01:20,846 --> 01:01:23,488
Tough talk, Mister.
Hope you can back it up.

534
01:01:44,531 --> 01:01:45,557
Wow.

535
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:48,014
What a dump.

536
01:01:48,450 --> 01:01:50,179
And no homies either.

537
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:52,267
The monster keeps everyone away.

538
01:01:52,688 --> 01:01:54,643
This place has out of customer in years.

539
01:01:55,081 --> 01:01:55,651
Uh-uh.

540
01:01:55,900 --> 01:01:59,672
Location. Location. Location.

541
01:02:02,050 --> 01:02:07,184
Which is why it is the perfect
place for a rendezvous.

542
01:02:07,553 --> 01:02:10,512
So... Evilla Cruella.

543
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:12,122
We meet at last.

544
01:02:12,750 --> 01:02:15,598
Dr Jones. You let us on a merry game,

545
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:17,111
but it's over now.

546
01:02:17,850 --> 01:02:20,129
I admit: you outsmarted me.

547
01:02:20,479 --> 01:02:21,507
You win.

548
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,641
Release her Drago.

549
01:02:23,641 --> 01:02:25,767
She has nowhere to run to.

550
01:02:25,798 --> 01:02:27,916
I think you realize that now.

551
01:02:29,050 --> 01:02:29,813
Thank you.

552
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:32,520
It's beginning to get ring-around-the-collar.

553
01:02:33,450 --> 01:02:35,605
- Drink?
- Make it a double.

554
01:02:39,529 --> 01:02:40,609
Hmmm...

555
01:02:41,721 --> 01:02:44,535
Dr Jones, you're a worthy opponent...

556
01:02:45,073 --> 01:02:47,428
and this doesn't have to end here.

557
01:02:50,450 --> 01:02:51,247
Do you tell?

558
01:02:51,254 --> 01:02:53,266
When I'm crowned Empress of Moronica,

559
01:02:53,266 --> 01:02:55,645
I'm gonna need a sharp mind
like yours around.

560
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:58,554
One that knows her way
around ancient treasures,

561
01:02:58,554 --> 01:03:01,253
and can handle herself
in tough situations.

562
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:07,410
Flattery will get you everything.

563
01:03:07,410 --> 01:03:08,950
But it cames at a price.

564
01:03:12,050 --> 01:03:14,242
We'll have all the money we desire.

565
01:03:14,242 --> 01:03:17,762
The ancient treasures of Aisha
will be ours to plunder.

566
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:21,757
I'm your girl.

567
01:03:22,301 --> 01:03:23,884
How do I know I can trust you?

568
01:03:24,553 --> 01:03:25,888
All my...

569
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:30,261
minions...
have proved their loyalty to me.

570
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:33,407
How about...

571
01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:37,767
I put out like a dime-store diva
à la tequila bender, huh? (***?)

572
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:39,690
Would that do it?

573
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:42,939
It's a start.

574
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:44,395
Drago?

575
01:03:54,054 --> 01:03:55,348
(I'll show you.)

576
01:10:17,650 --> 01:10:18,462
Well?

577
01:10:19,050 --> 01:10:20,714
I think I know where the temple is.

578
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:23,796
(First, you took a right and then the left,)

579
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,963
and then another right, and the left,

580
01:10:25,963 --> 01:10:27,216
and then you go straight.

581
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:28,909
So what's left?

582
01:10:29,050 --> 01:10:30,330
No. It's right.

583
01:10:30,950 --> 01:10:32,068
What's right?

584
01:10:32,050 --> 01:10:34,039
No, left. The left is right.

585
01:10:34,779 --> 01:10:37,124
The left is right?

586
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:38,017
Right.

587
01:10:38,250 --> 01:10:40,104
Can we just go now?

588
01:10:40,700 --> 01:10:41,702
Yeah. Let's go.

589
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:15,747
[*The monster roars*]

590
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:22,691
- Jones!
- What?

591
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:23,823
This way!

592
01:11:29,300 --> 01:11:30,149
Finally.

593
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:32,059
I knew the left was actually a right,

594
01:11:32,059 --> 01:11:33,154
and the right was right,

595
01:11:33,154 --> 01:11:34,080
and give him the wrong left. (***?)

596
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:35,913
That's the temple of Eros?

597
01:11:36,290 --> 01:11:38,031
Or a *** fried chicken?

598
01:11:38,450 --> 01:11:40,521
Come on! What are you waiting for?
Let's go!

599
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:47,942
I must say:

600
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:50,697
I thought it would be a bit grander.

601
01:11:51,950 --> 01:11:52,658
Look!

602
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:53,246
(Oh!)

603
01:11:53,246 --> 01:11:54,663
(The Tiara of Aisha!)

604
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:57,189
The key of the kingdom of Moronica.

605
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:07,107
Here.

606
01:12:06,994 --> 01:12:08,402
Let's try it out for size.

607
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:11,829
Well... If you insist...

608
01:12:13,178 --> 01:12:15,514
Not so fast.

609
01:12:16,650 --> 01:12:17,557
Damnit.

610
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:18,612
I'll take that.

611
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,361
Well it probably looks
better on you anyway.

612
01:12:27,750 --> 01:12:29,126
I don't think so.

613
01:12:30,083 --> 01:12:31,889
Son of a bitch!

614
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,055
I'll take that.

615
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:38,818
Lucky for us you came along.

616
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:40,456
Don't be so sure.

617
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:41,333
(Get your hands up.)

618
01:12:41,333 --> 01:12:42,022
(All of you.)

619
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:45,347
(Mr Martin,)

620
01:12:45,347 --> 01:12:46,156
You?

621
01:12:46,643 --> 01:12:48,647
Yes, me.

622
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:50,118
You think I'm an idiot?

623
01:12:50,950 --> 01:12:53,183
(I let you, imbeciles,
do all the heavy lifting.)

624
01:12:54,150 --> 01:12:55,142
Now...

625
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:58,375
It is my day in the sun.

626
01:12:59,250 --> 01:13:00,723
You mean...?

627
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,239
Yes.

628
01:13:02,574 --> 01:13:05,357
Dr Jones, you hit the nail on the head,

629
01:13:05,357 --> 01:13:07,272
(when you said "anyone",)

630
01:13:07,272 --> 01:13:08,947
even me,

631
01:13:08,947 --> 01:13:11,126
could become Empress of Moronica,

632
01:13:11,126 --> 01:13:15,368
if they had the Tiara of Aisha.

633
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:18,100
And now you have it.

634
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:19,210
That's right...

635
01:13:19,585 --> 01:13:24,000
and I am now the Empress of Moronica.

636
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:28,514
Oh...

637
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,679
Oh I feel so pretty...

638
01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:33,034
So pretty!

639
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:35,911
Say it!

640
01:13:36,350 --> 01:13:36,859
Yep.

641
01:13:36,888 --> 01:13:38,770
You're pretty alright.

642
01:13:39,100 --> 01:13:41,056
Yeah, very pretty.

643
01:13:41,792 --> 01:13:43,712
No doubt, a real looker.

644
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,189
Damn right I am.

645
01:13:47,950 --> 01:13:49,816
Well...

646
01:13:49,816 --> 01:13:50,839
Good night.

647
01:13:53,150 --> 01:13:55,256
That was seriously fucked up.

648
01:13:55,549 --> 01:13:57,043
Let's get him.

649
01:14:04,250 --> 01:14:06,554
[*Monster roars*]

650
01:14:10,645 --> 01:14:14,102
You can't eat me.
I'm too pretty.

651
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:18,830
[*gunshots*]

652
01:14:26,050 --> 01:14:27,050
Wow...

653
01:14:27,850 --> 01:14:29,381
Well...

654
01:14:29,381 --> 01:14:30,629
I guess that's it for him.

655
01:14:31,150 --> 01:14:33,086
There goes the Tiara.

656
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:36,168
He truly was queen for a day.

657
01:14:37,250 --> 01:14:38,997
Hey that thing's got a poop some time.

658
01:14:40,681 --> 01:14:42,858
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

659
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:44,967
First one in the poop gets a prize.

660
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:51,245
Which one follows?

661
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:54,732
That's an adventure best left
for another day.

662
01:14:55,201 --> 01:14:57,531
Finally, we both agree on something.

663
01:15:03,651 --> 01:15:06,947
I have no intention of becoming
queen of the morons.

664
01:15:07,350 --> 01:15:08,970
That's your job.

665
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:17,242
I work for the rightful owner of that idol:

666
01:15:17,242 --> 01:15:20,579
Evilla Cruella. The heir to the Empire Moronica.

667
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:29,977
I will have that idol ***.

668
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:45,016
But I couldn't tell them anything
cuz I didn't know anything.

669
01:15:45,016 --> 01:15:45,835
You know?

670
01:15:55,680 --> 01:15:57,183
I think I got the bugs out.

671
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:03,853
That's right.

672
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:05,815
I saw you on the second floor.

673
01:16:06,245 --> 01:16:07,524
You do good work.

674
01:16:14,011 --> 01:16:16,775
Oh... I feel so pretty.
