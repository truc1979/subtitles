2
00:00:41,911 --> 00:00:45,441
How many times do I have to say it,
I like to see you suck it.

3
00:00:45,631 --> 00:00:48,930
I also told you

4
00:00:59,918 --> 00:01:02,075
I can not do it with light.

5
00:01:03,056 --> 00:01:05,924
Come on, you can do it.

6
00:02:53,497 --> 00:02:56,210
Where are you going?
It's 2 a.m.

7
00:02:57,782 --> 00:03:01,101
I'm leaving, baby.
You know...?

8
00:03:02,777 --> 00:03:07,642
For years, every time we do it
It seems that it is your first time.

9
00:03:09,313 --> 00:03:10,359
I hate you.

10
00:03:11,604 --> 00:03:14,527
Every time I take you, it seems
I ask you a favor.

11
00:03:16,455 --> 00:03:17,859
That good!

12
00:03:17,859 --> 00:03:20,856
Just because you want to do it
with the light on.

13
00:03:21,424 --> 00:03:23,736
That is the only reason in your life.

14
00:03:24,855 --> 00:03:28,589
- Yes.
- Where will you go?

15
00:03:28,723 --> 00:03:32,180
You go with your secretary Tyna.

16
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:38,165
- Yes.
- And what will you say to your son?

17
00:03:38,746 --> 00:03:40,864
No no. Wait.

18
00:03:40,864 --> 00:03:46,314
I'll tell him that his father's shit leaves us
for some kind of teenage slut.

19
00:03:50,117 --> 00:03:55,706
Tomorrow put it on the phone and if you want,
Let him come with me and Tyna.

20
00:03:58,126 --> 00:04:00,556
I have to do it. I have to do it.

21
00:04:03,082 --> 00:04:05,023
See you never.

22
00:04:05,423 --> 00:04:08,497
He will be away for a long time.

23
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,148
Mom will come back It's just a fight.
It happened before.

24
00:04:12,275 --> 00:04:14,315
Forget it, it will not come back.

25
00:04:16,367 --> 00:04:18,647
You must think if you want to live with him.

26
00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:23,806
Oh mom, I want to stay with you.

27
00:04:24,087 --> 00:04:27,644
No honey, it's already decided.
And I do not want to talk about that.

28
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,826
He will call you later.

29
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:34,755
Could work.

30
00:04:34,827 --> 00:04:36,490
And of what?

31
00:04:37,207 --> 00:04:39,246
You can not leave school.

32
00:04:39,514 --> 00:04:43,481
You are not going to leave.
I will get a job.

33
00:04:44,011 --> 00:04:47,547
Not exactly first.

34
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:51,838
Do not tell me.

3. 4

35
00:04:52,052 --> 00:04:54,385
You are not in decadence.

36
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:57,466
Thank you, little sun.

37
00:05:32,542 --> 00:05:33,659
- Hello?

38
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:36,946
Barbara.

39
00:05:37,547 --> 00:05:41,242
What are you doing at this time?

40
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,054
Gyna, you will not believe me.

41
00:05:43,354 --> 00:05:45,555
I do not believe it myself.

42
00:05:45,555 --> 00:05:47,973
Chirs abandoned me.

43
00:05:48,822 --> 00:05:50,379
- I do not believe you.

44
00:05:50,379 --> 00:05:54,515
The son of a bitch left me
by Tyna, the secretary.

45
00:05:56,734 --> 00:05:58,927
Are you looking for a job?

46
00:06:00,585 --> 00:06:02,123
We had lunch?

47
00:06:02,602 --> 00:06:05,595
Sure, it's fine.

48
00:06:06,459 --> 00:06:08,973
Well, see you later.

49
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:17,860
It's time to wake up.

50
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,973
Gyna wants breakfast.

fifty

51
00:07:38,385 --> 00:07:40,620
Hello darling, sit down.

52
00:07:41,005 --> 00:07:44,541
Tell me.
You need a drink

53
00:07:50,477 --> 00:07:54,737
Now tell me,
What the hell is wrong with Chris?

54
00:07:55,577 --> 00:07:58,941
Go figure.
Even I can not believe it.

55
00:07:59,204 --> 00:08:03,588
He abandoned his son
and me for a whore.

56
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:06,410
An opportunistic bitch.

57
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:07,729
Tell me about her.

58
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:11,183
I only know that she is a secretary.

59
00:08:11,183 --> 00:08:12,975
1.70, 25 years.

60
00:08:12,975 --> 00:08:17,636
As I said: "One moment you are up,
and to the short while down ".

61
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:22,489
Barbara, what you need
He is a new guy.

62
00:08:22,962 --> 00:08:26,286
I'll find you a sexy young man.

63
00:08:27,665 --> 00:08:32,926
No thanks. I have to think
much in my lost ego.

64
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:35,127
It is not necessary to
lose the feeling.

65
00:08:35,127 --> 00:08:37,230
It is going to shrink you.

66
00:08:39,306 --> 00:08:43,487
I insist I know a guy who
will please

67
00:08:43,913 --> 00:08:47,488
I do not say it for me.
But it would be perfect for you.

68
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:53,565
How is the job search?

69
00:08:53,565 --> 00:08:56,421
Are you kidding? If you have up
25, they do not even look at you.

70
00:08:57,766 --> 00:08:59,994
Nobody wants to give me a job.

71
00:08:59,994 --> 00:09:04,128
That is very bad.

72
00:09:05,095 --> 00:09:10,738
Wait a minute.
Who was the one who helped me in crisis?

73
00:09:11,069 --> 00:09:13,168
When I got divorced years ago

74
00:09:13,168 --> 00:09:17,619
It came from the other side.
What was it called?

75
00:09:18,464 --> 00:09:20,350
I was after you.

76
00:09:23,359 --> 00:09:26,681
Jerry Morgan,
I had not thought of it.

77
00:09:26,908 --> 00:09:31,168
And his office is nearby.
Could be.

78
00:09:35,731 --> 00:09:38,620
I think I'll eat fish.

79
00:09:41,592 --> 00:09:46,509
Now Barbara, tell me how is that
beautiful son of yours, Paul.

80
00:09:46,737 --> 00:09:49,050
It must be really big now, right?

81
00:09:53,825 --> 00:09:56,042
Stay still.

82
00:09:56,283 --> 00:09:58,623
In what year was the Battle of Hastings?

83
00:09:59,431 --> 00:10:02,206
Open your legs
and I tell you in what year.

84
00:10:04,089 --> 00:10:07,887
- In what year was the Battle of Hastings?
- 1066

85
00:10:09,739 --> 00:10:12,761
Wait.

86
00:10:21,762 --> 00:10:27,762
In what year did Alexander invade Persia?
- 333 BC., And enough questions.

87
00:10:28,763 --> 00:10:31,763
Oh Paul, you're so smart.

88
00:10:33,764 --> 00:10:36,764
You know all the answers.

89
00:10:36,865 --> 00:10:39,765
You deserve a reward.

90
00:12:08,786 --> 00:12:13,415
Do they study history,
or sex education?

91
00:12:14,018 --> 00:12:17,728
Porn is our hobby.

92
00:12:18,068 --> 00:12:20,397
You were not going for a few copies.

93
00:12:22,479 --> 00:12:25,780
You never told me it was so big!

94
00:12:26,171 --> 00:12:28,454
Well, I'm leaving.

95
00:12:29,343 --> 00:12:31,962
Wait, do not go.

96
00:12:32,282 --> 00:12:36,040
Guess what. I will leave
try it a bit.

97
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,500
I let you eat it
if you promise to return it.

98
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:40,739
Promise it.

99
00:12:42,448 --> 00:12:49,586
Well, but I will not give it back
as soon.

100
00:16:40,507 --> 00:16:42,851
Paul, are you home?

101
00:16:42,851 --> 00:16:44,980
Yes mom.

102
00:16:52,487 --> 00:16:54,600
Dinner is almost ready.
How did it go?

103
00:16:54,892 --> 00:16:59,360
I'm tired.

104
00:17:00,292 --> 00:17:02,661
Honey, have you talked to your father?

105
00:17:02,661 --> 00:17:05,776
Yes, we talk.

106
00:17:06,882 --> 00:17:08,326
And good?

107
00:17:09,832 --> 00:17:15,693
- You know I'll stay with you.
- Honey, I feel so happy.

108
00:17:24,054 --> 00:17:26,402
You know mom. I was thinking...

109
00:17:26,402 --> 00:17:28,594
I want to look for a job.

110
00:17:28,594 --> 00:17:30,789
I already told you,
no way.

111
00:17:31,574 --> 00:17:34,637
Your father is going to pay
the school.

112
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:37,269
- And besides, you know what?
- What?

113
00:17:37,269 --> 00:17:40,695
- Today I found work.
- Are you kidding.

114
00:17:41,032 --> 00:17:42,233
Of what? Where?

115
00:17:42,538 --> 00:17:48,177
Well, do you remember Morgan?
He helped Gyna years ago.

116
00:17:48,424 --> 00:17:53,366
Well, I went to see him today.
Your office is nearby.

117
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:55,859
And he found me a job.

118
00:17:56,216 --> 00:17:59,485
I never thought he would help me.

119
00:17:59,485 --> 00:18:02,719
Congratulations for your work.

120
00:18:50,473 --> 00:18:53,275
Hi. I say Morgan.

121
00:18:53,776 --> 00:18:58,178
It's me, did Charlie call you?

122
00:18:58,717 --> 00:19:00,047
Are you going out tonight?

123
00:19:00,047 --> 00:19:02,912
If he did.
And if I am.

124
00:19:02,912 --> 00:19:06,553
Gyna, are you sure I should do it?

125
00:19:15,283 --> 00:19:19,191
You could talk later,
This is very important.

126
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:21,676
Sure, Gyna, I'll leave you, I have
than write a letter.

127
00:19:23,292 --> 00:19:26,485
Gyna, are you sure about this?

128
00:19:26,648 --> 00:19:29,873
Barbara. Charlie walks
with other girls.

129
00:19:30,397 --> 00:19:32,747
You are not going to church.

130
00:19:32,747 --> 00:19:35,760
OK, I will go...

131
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,052
What's wrong Jerry ...

132
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:39,920
What's going on there?

133
00:19:41,716 --> 00:19:43,449
Is Jerry raping you?

134
00:19:43,887 --> 00:19:45,725
Leave me son of a bitch.

135
00:19:49,851 --> 00:19:51,689
I do not want this, nor do I need it.

136
00:19:54,421 --> 00:19:58,138
What are you doing?
Did you get your cock?

137
00:20:00,352 --> 00:20:02,481
I want my money, I resign.

138
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:06,027
Jerry, I never thought about you.

139
00:20:06,027 --> 00:20:08,688
After so many years.

140
00:20:10,602 --> 00:20:14,001
Barbara, I do not want you to think
that...

141
00:20:14,295 --> 00:20:16,548
I've always thought of you ...

142
00:20:16,741 --> 00:20:20,362
Still being married.

143
00:20:20,745 --> 00:20:23,542
Since I saw you...

144
00:20:25,437 --> 00:20:29,387
Please, do not give up ...
Think about it.

145
00:20:30,017 --> 00:20:31,729
Come tomorrow?

146
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:34,749
Promise me that you will think about it.

147
00:20:35,387 --> 00:20:38,888
If you promise not to do it again.

148
00:20:43,021 --> 00:20:45,574
Well, but this is why I will reduce you
The salary.

149
00:20:57,011 --> 00:20:59,427
Oh my god, I'm very excited.

150
00:21:00,706 --> 00:21:02,659
I thought he was raping her.

151
00:21:07,424 --> 00:21:09,287
I'm so hot

152
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:16,257
Just play with my shell.

153
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,379
You know how I like it, do not you?

154
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,877
I know, I'm going to take off my pantyhose.

155
00:21:55,127 --> 00:21:55,847
Is not it better?

156
00:22:20,603 --> 00:22:24,566
Let me go down there so they can
give some of my attention.

157
00:22:26,825 --> 00:22:29,406
Bring that nice sweet conchita
for here.

158
00:25:30,797 --> 00:25:33,703
Sit over there, I'll see if
is mom

159
00:25:44,775 --> 00:25:46,842
Hey Paul, look.

160
00:31:02,765 --> 00:31:06,607
God, you're always so hot.

161
00:31:25,493 --> 00:31:28,218
Paul, I did not know you were home.
Hi, Sherry.

162
00:31:28,218 --> 00:31:31,880
- Hello, mrs. Scott.
- Honey, I'm sorry, I did not make dinner.

163
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,900
Your decrepit mom has a date.

164
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:39,009
- Do not worry.

165
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,704
- To a good time.
- Thank you.

166
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:18,130
What are you doing in that corner, baby?

167
00:33:20,087 --> 00:33:21,966
Do I have bad breath or something?

168
00:33:22,966 --> 00:33:24,994
I feel very comfortable here. Thank you.

169
00:33:26,394 --> 00:33:28,134
Come on, come closer.

170
00:33:29,939 --> 00:33:31,510
I thought you were swinger.

171
00:33:33,794 --> 00:33:35,247
And I thought you were underfunded.

172
00:33:37,031 --> 00:33:39,272
What did you say?
Nothing. Nothing important.

173
00:35:36,656 --> 00:35:38,880
Gina told me that you just got divorced.

174
00:35:40,287 --> 00:35:43,109
You must be ready to have
a little action, is not it, baby?

175
00:40:37,208 --> 00:40:40,511
I had never been
given in that way.

176
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:45,824
You really turn on me honey.

177
00:41:12,465 --> 00:41:14,717
Come on baby, cheer up.

178
00:41:15,269 --> 00:41:17,898
It seems you do not like it.

179
00:41:19,625 --> 00:41:21,952
What kind of party is this?

180
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:26,221
It is a great party.
Did Gyna never tell you?

181
00:41:27,145 --> 00:41:31,538
No. Exchange of couples?
Orgy?

182
00:41:32,647 --> 00:41:34,818
I think I'll go home.

183
00:41:35,136 --> 00:41:39,221
Go home?
Trash.

184
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:45,292
You came with me,
and I will not let you go.

185
00:41:53,103 --> 00:41:58,216
Maylene, baby.
I like to meet you.

186
00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:04,840
Come here Charlie.

187
00:42:04,982 --> 00:42:07,689
Come on, baby.
Enjoy the party.

188
00:42:07,689 --> 00:42:09,991
I do not want to take part.

189
00:42:09,991 --> 00:42:14,422
Fuck you, baby.
You have to wait for me.

190
00:45:10,718 --> 00:45:13,545
By God, you could be my son!

191
00:45:58,784 --> 00:46:00,569
Hey, you are very beautiful!

192
00:46:00,791 --> 00:46:01,893
Please!

193
00:46:03,073 --> 00:46:04,333
Let me see that you have
under the dress.

194
00:46:06,275 --> 00:46:07,329
I just want to see a little.

195
00:46:08,372 --> 00:46:09,238
Do not!

196
00:46:10,388 --> 00:46:13,106
Why not? Just leave me
take a look.

197
00:46:14,223 --> 00:46:15,500
Let's go.

198
00:46:16,418 --> 00:46:17,599
Do you want me to ask you more
friendly?

199
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:19,780
Enough!

200
00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:21,720
Let's go to another room.

201
00:46:25,089 --> 00:46:26,298
You are very rigid.

202
00:46:30,665 --> 00:46:33,112
Please.
Please.

203
00:46:33,784 --> 00:46:35,029
Stop.

204
00:46:52,030 --> 00:46:54,500
Fuck baby, I got tired
from this!

205
00:52:21,358 --> 00:52:23,579
It was very good.

206
00:52:26,162 --> 00:52:27,384
Great, baby.

207
00:52:29,383 --> 00:52:31,037
They left me dry!

208
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:36,222
Well, I'm ready.
Let's go baby.

209
00:52:53,432 --> 00:52:56,311
Do you want me to call you
next friday?

210
00:52:56,792 --> 00:52:59,595
Save your time, Charlie.

211
01:02:55,241 --> 01:02:58,664
Dear Paul. We lost our
heads last night

212
01:02:59,255 --> 01:03:02,147
What happened was
terribly wrong.

213
01:03:02,147 --> 01:03:04,832
We will talk tonight
When I get home.

214
01:03:05,828 --> 01:03:07,945
With love. Your mother.

215
01:03:25,222 --> 01:03:27,307
Barbara, can you answer the
phone please?

216
01:03:32,316 --> 01:03:36,514
Ah, it's you Gynna.
I'm not in the mood to talk.

217
01:03:36,514 --> 01:03:38,211
I'll call you later.

218
01:03:40,061 --> 01:03:43,906
Charlie was an idiot.
And the party was terrible.

219
01:03:45,940 --> 01:03:49,191
Everything is collapsing.

220
01:03:50,147 --> 01:03:51,786
I'll call you later.

221
01:03:58,969 --> 01:04:01,690
Are you okay honey?
What happens?

222
01:04:03,265 --> 01:04:05,624
Nothing will make you feel better.

223
01:04:07,430 --> 01:04:10,801
- Take the day off.
- But there's a lot to do.

224
01:04:11,692 --> 01:04:15,305
I propose you something.
Let's take the day ...

225
01:04:15,782 --> 01:04:19,846
We will go to lunch.
And maybe later you feel better.

226
01:04:22,832 --> 01:04:24,628
Let's move on.

227
01:05:24,876 --> 01:05:26,467
For the lady.

228
01:08:27,582 --> 01:08:30,503
Thanks for this day Charlie.
You're adorable.

229
01:08:31,208 --> 01:08:33,748
You already know me, I'm a good boy.

230
01:08:34,701 --> 01:08:37,633
Let `s go inside.
We can not leave it that simple.

231
01:08:37,772 --> 01:08:39,432
Maybe it will not happen again.

232
01:08:39,541 --> 01:08:41,167
Not Jerry, not tonight.

233
01:08:41,167 --> 01:08:44,365
You have been very sweet and the
I've had a good time

234
01:08:44,541 --> 01:08:49,550
But ... What's wrong Jerry?
Better see you tomorrow, yes?

235
01:08:51,143 --> 01:08:53,093
Now I have to go.

236
01:08:53,237 --> 01:08:54,156
It's okay.

237
01:09:11,469 --> 01:09:13,136
Paul, I arrived.

238
01:09:14,034 --> 01:09:15,863
Yes mom. I'm here.

239
01:09:19,066 --> 01:09:22,044
Hi Mom.
I have been waiting for you.

240
01:09:24,314 --> 01:09:28,798
Paul, it's serious.
What happened was my fault.

241
01:09:29,468 --> 01:09:32,589
I do not want you to feel guilty
of what I did to you

242
01:09:33,054 --> 01:09:34,640
I thought we had done it together.

243
01:09:35,323 --> 01:09:37,476
You were very adorable

244
01:09:37,775 --> 01:09:40,425
Have my son in my arms again.

245
01:09:43,131 --> 01:09:46,639
Like when you were little.

246
01:09:48,409 --> 01:09:50,086
But it's wrong.

247
01:09:51,817 --> 01:09:55,416
Look Mom. I do not think less
of none of us.

248
01:09:56,366 --> 01:10:00,021
It happened.
And I have to tell you ...

249
01:10:01,189 --> 01:10:03,022
I want it to happen again.

250
01:10:08,399 --> 01:10:10,952
The Law has an ugly
word for this.

251
01:10:12,425 --> 01:10:14,344
Nobody has to know.

252
01:10:14,662 --> 01:10:17,811
Just you and me.

253
01:10:18,798 --> 01:10:21,464
Paul, I'm talking about incest.

254
01:15:48,338 --> 01:15:51,075
Shit, who could it be?

255
01:16:32,246 --> 01:16:35,302
- I interrupt you?
- Not really.

256
01:16:35,494 --> 01:16:39,318
I was just with my beautiful and young
male inside

257
01:16:39,318 --> 01:16:43,418
And a young girl with the sweetest and most beautiful
vagina that you have tried.

258
01:16:45,103 --> 01:16:46,304
But it's okay.

259
01:16:46,618 --> 01:16:48,821
They are only orgasms.

260
01:16:49,041 --> 01:16:51,140
But what happens?

261
01:16:51,826 --> 01:16:54,499
Are not you still angry about
your date with Charlie?

262
01:16:54,537 --> 01:16:59,001
No no.
I just want to talk to someone.

263
01:16:59,495 --> 01:17:01,835
You always told me.

264
01:17:01,835 --> 01:17:04,734
I told you. It's natural.

265
01:17:05,380 --> 01:17:07,579
But what do you want to talk about?

266
01:17:09,260 --> 01:17:12,014
I can not even see it.

267
01:17:12,792 --> 01:17:15,312
I wonder what's wrong with me.

268
01:17:16,221 --> 01:17:18,298
Just tell me who it is.

269
01:17:18,566 --> 01:17:20,592
What's going on?

270
01:17:22,889 --> 01:17:26,588
- Paul, Paul and I ...
- Paul?

271
01:17:28,436 --> 01:17:34,921
Paul and you ...?
You say you took your son?

272
01:17:36,029 --> 01:17:40,059
The worst of all is that I
I'm falling in love with Jerry.

273
01:17:40,841 --> 01:17:42,772
Forget about Jerry.

274
01:17:46,950 --> 01:17:48,920
Tell me about Paul.

275
01:17:50,674 --> 01:17:56,238
When we touch
When his hands caress my body ...

276
01:17:57,927 --> 01:18:00,613
I want to have it inside me.

277
01:18:04,342 --> 01:18:05,788
Did he do it to you?

278
01:18:06,216 --> 01:18:08,661
Your vagina ate you.

279
01:18:09,389 --> 01:18:12,204
I did not let him, he just did it.

280
01:18:12,919 --> 01:18:14,878
This is very exciting.

281
01:18:15,544 --> 01:18:17,709
Did you suck it?

282
01:18:24,361 --> 01:18:26,657
Did it end in your mouth?

283
01:18:32,183 --> 01:18:35,320
Liters and liters of semen?

284
01:18:37,633 --> 01:18:39,863
I'm finishing.

285
01:18:57,776 --> 01:19:01,473
I can not believe it,
Gynna, I came to ask you for help ...

286
01:19:01,473 --> 01:19:03,791
and all you do is have
orgasms throughout the room.

287
01:19:04,614 --> 01:19:08,621
- What I am going to do?
- Do not worry.

288
01:19:09,042 --> 01:19:13,570
What kind of advice is that?
And my best friend!

289
01:19:14,431 --> 01:19:19,033
I'm sorry, Barbara.
I do not know what to tell you.

290
01:19:19,033 --> 01:19:24,192
I never imagined anyone
fucking his own son.

291
01:19:25,093 --> 01:19:27,368
I'd better see you later.

292
01:19:31,092 --> 01:19:32,847
You're good?

293
01:19:33,585 --> 01:19:35,822
Where are you going?

294
01:19:35,822 --> 01:19:39,069
I do not know where.
See you later.

295
01:19:58,729 --> 01:20:02,671
Imagine catching your own son.

296
01:20:04,742 --> 01:20:06,830
Honey, what time will I eat?

297
01:20:09,477 --> 01:20:11,150
In a few minutes.

298
01:20:11,973 --> 01:20:14,713
No, Paul can see us.

299
01:20:14,844 --> 01:20:19,254
Listen to this too,
maybe we will not open

300
01:20:19,580 --> 01:20:21,594
What do you think if we travel?

301
01:20:21,965 --> 01:20:25,224
- Travel?
- Yes, did not I tell you?

302
01:20:25,591 --> 01:20:31,609
- I have to take care of something.
- No, you did not say it.

303
01:20:32,057 --> 01:20:35,164
Why do not you come.
You bring your son.

304
01:20:35,164 --> 01:20:36,479
You can join us

305
01:20:36,974 --> 01:20:40,655
It sounds beautiful.

306
01:20:41,346 --> 01:20:44,027
I can not, I'm very busy.

307
01:20:46,330 --> 01:20:47,495
See you.

308
01:20:47,935 --> 01:20:50,676
What happens?
You have not tried anything

309
01:21:00,316 --> 01:21:01,204
What will happen to him?

310
01:21:02,014 --> 01:21:03,908
You know how teenagers are.

311
01:21:07,220 --> 01:21:08,273
Finally alone.

312
01:21:13,518 --> 01:21:15,566
All this food and still
I'm hungry.

313
01:21:19,142 --> 01:21:21,640
Come, I'll give you the dessert.

314
01:21:29,790 --> 01:21:31,732
You must know, Barbra.

315
01:21:32,182 --> 01:21:34,132
I was always in love with you.

316
01:21:34,898 --> 01:21:37,232
I already noticed Jerry.

317
01:24:43,149 --> 01:24:45,183
I hope you feel for me.

318
01:24:45,183 --> 01:24:46,873
The same as I feel for you.

319
01:24:47,641 --> 01:24:49,397
Do you want us to get married?

320
01:24:52,388 --> 01:24:55,154
Jerry, you have made me very happy.

321
01:24:55,188 --> 01:25:01,958
But please, do not pressure me.
I have to reorder my priorities.

322
01:25:04,065 --> 01:25:06,577
What do you mean by that?

323
01:25:07,134 --> 01:25:10,794
From now on, my life
it's my life.

324
01:25:10,794 --> 01:25:13,473
I want to do things
my way.

325
01:25:13,843 --> 01:25:17,301
And part of my way, is to conserve you
as my lover.

326
01:25:17,982 --> 01:25:19,664
And what is the other part?
