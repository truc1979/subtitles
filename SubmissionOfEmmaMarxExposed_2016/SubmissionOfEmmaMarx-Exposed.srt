00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:21,840
In life,

3
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,720
we'll sometimes play
roles to mask who we are.

4
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,709
To hide our fears, protect our hearts.

5
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,679
We'll smile through the pain,

6
00:00:30,999 --> 00:00:32,519
laugh at bad jokes.

7
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,340
Tell others we're okay
when we're really not.

8
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,120
But who are we when
that mask comes down?

9
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,260
When we can no longer hide?

10
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,760
When we must exist
in that raw open space...

11
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,530
...of truth.

12
00:01:16,099 --> 00:01:16,829
So...

13
00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:20,079
You know the reception is downstairs, right?

14
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,550
Yeah...

15
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:23,240
I came up here to be alone.

16
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,910
Are you friends with the
bride or the groom?

17
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:28,250
The bride.

18
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,121
Oh, okay. Me too.

19
00:01:30,121 --> 00:01:31,211
How do you know her?

20
00:01:32,211 --> 00:01:35,302
- She's an old friend.
- She's an old friend of mine too!

21
00:01:35,302 --> 00:01:38,072
And no: we didn't date.

22
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:39,530
If you were wondering.

23
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,019
I wasn't.

24
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,260
So listen: I'm new to
this town and uh...

25
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:47,010
I was wondering if uh... you
could show me around town, and uh...

26
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,690
No.

27
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:51,660
Wow... you just wound up
really tight, aren't you?

28
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,880
No. I'm just not interested.

29
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,641
Hm. Playing hard to get, huh?

30
00:01:56,641 --> 00:01:57,951
I like it.

31
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,869
You'll be doing me in
my hotel before midnight.

32
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,480
And now I just want to
rip all these buttons off.

33
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,040
I like the way you're talking.

34
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,510
Wait wait wait...

35
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:17,680
Do you think we should
call the babysitter first?

36
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,670
She told us we got all day.

37
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:20,800
Okay...

38
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,220
But I mean like should
we check on Isabelle...

39
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:24,760
Jesus...

40
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,090
It's been a few hours.

41
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,300
Look honey, you are
ruining the fantasy, okay?

42
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:32,401
Alright, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right.

43
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,300
Okay. We ***, alright?

44
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,990
This is just a one-time thing.

45
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,380
I'm not looking for a relationship.

46
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,209
Good. Me neither.

47
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,799
Oh my gosh, you're gonna make me come.

48
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,190
Yeah... don't stop.

49
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,200
Oh my god... wow...

50
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,540
You're really good at that.

51
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:02,209
- Really pretty genitals.
- Thank you.

52
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,060
I want to see what it looks like.

53
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,409
There's nothing like sucking a cock
that you haven't sucked before.

54
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,200
Oh, you wear special panties for me?

55
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,900
You never know if you're gonna get lucky.

56
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,880
Oh, so fucking true.

57
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,599
But I always know.

58
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,709
You often have one night stands?

59
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:45,489
Oh yeah...

60
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,579
You'll never have to talk
to me again right?

61
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,970
I'm never gonna talk to you again.

62
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,791
That's cool, ***

63
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,599
I think this is your
favorite position, uh?

64
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,660
Is that your regular gig to
find a horny girl at a wedding?

65
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,240
It just depends on the wedding.

66
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,179
'Cause my pussy is so wet,
this is sliding all over.

67
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,511
Don't tease me too much.

68
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,039
You're gonna make me come again.

69
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:46,770
*** pussy tightening around your cock.

70
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,660
That was fun.

71
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:19,210
I've never had a one-night stand before.

72
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,500
Yeah, you have.

73
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,450
Ray, stay in character!

74
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,751
Yeah. Oh yeah, yeah yeah.

75
00:27:25,751 --> 00:27:27,811
Okay. I got it.

76
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,630
Okay. We should probably
go check on the baby.

77
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:35,590
Oh! Yeah, yeah...

78
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,569
Yeah, it's just been our new thing you know,

79
00:27:40,569 --> 00:27:43,959
just like how you guys are playing
with your whips and your chains,

80
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,540
He's been really into
the whole role thing...

81
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,790
(...it's been amazing...)

82
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,320
Oh, oh, really?

83
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,410
No way.

84
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,061
But of course we can't
have Isabella at the house

85
00:27:55,061 --> 00:27:57,090
because you know, she's a little baby.

86
00:27:57,090 --> 00:27:59,180
So we're gonna take her to mom's house...

87
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,670
Oh yeah, that sounds like fun.

88
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,700
Emma?

89
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,800
Are you even listening to
anything that I'm saying?

90
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,680
Oh yeah of course I'm listening.

91
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,370
You know, you sound like you're zoning out.

92
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:13,669
Why don't you call me back when you
actually have an interest in my life?

93
00:28:20,239 --> 00:28:21,409
Please...

94
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,319
Please let me come right now, please...

95
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:27,340
Can I come? Can I?

96
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,740
Nope.

97
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,370
Do you have any idea how
much I hate you right now?

98
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:47,409
"Hate" was the farthest thing to
how I felt about Mr Frederick.

99
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:54,979
In the last year we'd gone
through a lot of changes.

100
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,220
We'd relocated to Atlanta
Georgia for his company.

101
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:04,219
If uprooting your entire life doesn't
bring a relationship closer together,

102
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,850
nothing will.

103
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,140
And we were closer than ever.

104
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,660
Four years ago,

105
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:25,301
I never would have pictured
being in a relationship with a man

106
00:29:25,301 --> 00:29:27,350
that I'd move the country for.

107
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:30,470
But falling in love often changes you.

108
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,630
Mr Frederick and I had fallen into
such a beautiful pattern.

109
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,669
Not the kind that couples dread
but the kind that really works.

110
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,920
The kind that gave us a handful of days to

111
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:47,670
reconnect with some semblance of normalcy.

112
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:52,739
While still providing us enough time
to relish our deviances.

113
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:09,839
Balancing the two wasn't always easy.

114
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,399
I'd become so accustomed to being his sub,

115
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:15,259
that downshifting to conventional
living at times...

116
00:30:15,259 --> 00:30:16,719
...proved challenging.

117
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,669
Are you masturbating at the dinner table?

118
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:34,480
Yes.

119
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,810
Are you going to punish me?

120
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:40,890
No, it's your day off.

121
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,550
He was strict about
honoring those days off.

122
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:54,539
No matter how hard I
tried to persuade him.

123
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,480
Tempting emma but no.

124
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,900
You are so mean.

125
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:13,480
But that just made our
"days on" all the more sweet.

126
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,590
For me there was no
greater pleasure than those days.

127
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:23,169
Waking up, knowing I
got to play his sub.

128
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,630
Not that I was playing at all.

129
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:32,900
The truth was I felt
more myself as his sub,

130
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,530
as his sub than I ever did as Emma.

131
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:37,619
There was barely a trace
of her left anymore.

132
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:39,979
I was fearless,

133
00:31:39,979 --> 00:31:42,749
with hard-nose becoming
ever more infrequent.

134
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,159
In fact, putting limits
on my experiences

135
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:49,240
had become more terrifying
to me than taking risks.

136
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,100
Stick it in.

137
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:18,350
I love how cold it
is when it first goes in.

138
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,240
- Do you like watching that?
- Yeah...

139
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:48,479
I'm so full right now...

140
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,989
I love how much you enjoy this.

141
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:22,399
Why is that?

142
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,839
I don't know.

143
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,180
It doesn't hurt?

144
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:30,749
It's a little uncomfortable, but

145
00:34:30,749 --> 00:34:33,839
there's nothing I can't handle.

146
00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:38,639
So would you say you enjoy anal, vaginal,

147
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,740
or both the same time the most?

148
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,050
Do you realize that anal sex has become

149
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:47,120
your favorite topic of discussion with me?

150
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,800
You love the fact that you turn me on

151
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,210
to something i used to be terrified of.

152
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Don't you?

153
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,510
No easy feet (***?)

154
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,910
So which is it?

155
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:09,019
I don't know...

156
00:35:09,968 --> 00:35:11,968
It's so hard to choose...

157
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,520
Would you prefer it if it was a...

158
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,840
...another man's dick in
there rather than just a toy?

159
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,210
Is this a hypothetical question
or a serious one?

160
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:27,359
Serious.

161
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,210
It's not a no...

162
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:35,140
...but it's not a yes either.

163
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:42,489
You surprised me more
than anybody i've ever met.

164
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,000
Why did you think I was going to say no?

165
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,211
Yeah.

166
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,920
Yes i did.

167
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,340
You know, I'm not the
same Emma I used to be.

168
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,481
I have a lot of insane fantasies now.

169
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,770
And that's all because of you.

170
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,250
No, that's all because of you.

171
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,890
I'm just the catalyst.

172
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:06,219
I love making your cock so hard.

173
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,400
I love having your cock inside me.

174
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:59,430
I have to clean all this
pussy off your cock first.

175
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,689
I'm freaking out!

176
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:55,670
(Is that a maid uniform?)

177
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:58,539
- Yeah, it's role playing night.
(- Okay.)

178
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,610
(So what's wrong?)

179
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:01,820
This!

180
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,290
(Why? I mean it suits you.)

181
00:44:04,290 --> 00:44:05,200
No!

182
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,520
It's not supposed to suit me,

183
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,110
it's supposed to be me
pretending to be someone else.

184
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:12,040
Right.

185
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,370
You're his maid.

186
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:15,520
But I'm already his maid:

187
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,750
I do the housework, I do the dishes,

188
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:19,280
I scrub the toilets...

189
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,670
And now I dress like his maid.

190
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,700
Nadia, maids do not dress like that.

191
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:27,599
They wear rubber gloves and sweatpants,

192
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:29,659
not push-up bras and short shorts.

193
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:32,419
When a husband dresses
his wife like a maid,

194
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:35,480
that's it, that's the end of their sex life.

195
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:36,870
Like what else is that for?

196
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,100
As inane as this might sound,

197
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:41,850
I was a little envious of Nadia that night.

198
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,300
Regardless of her issue with Ray's fantasies,

199
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:46,100
at least he shared them with her.

200
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,400
Mr Frederick had always focused on mine,

201
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,450
always shying away from sharing his.

202
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:53,100
And I wanted desperately
for him to open to me.

203
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:54,990
The way Ray had with Nadia.

204
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,480
You did remarkably well tonight.

205
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,299
I can't believe you lasted the whole time.

206
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:11,320
I've gotten very good with restraints.

207
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,280
Well it's reward time,

208
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,520
I'll drop a bath in a while.

209
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,970
I want to request
permission for another reward.

210
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:43,200
All right, permission granted.

211
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:53,041
I want to hear about some of your fantasies.

212
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:54,860
What do you mean?

213
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,240
I tell you about my fantasies all the time.

214
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:59,030
In fact, I, usually,

215
00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:01,530
issue them as direct orders.

216
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,580
Things that you haven't experienced yet,

217
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,470
and things that you want to experience.

218
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:08,669
Not just for me.

219
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:13,070
I love that you push me
to explore my sexuality,

220
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:16,200
and it doesn't always have to be about me.

221
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,559
I want it to be about you too.

222
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:22,400
In fact, you've told me that you

223
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,490
fantasized about being with other women.

224
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:26,530
Yes.

225
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,110
So why not act on that?

226
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,680
I don't know why you're
afraid to tell me these things,

227
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:34,130
it's a fantasy of yours and...

228
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:38,300
...we're definitely known for turning
fantasies into reality, so...

229
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:40,120
why not that reality?

230
00:46:41,650 --> 00:46:43,010
Where is this coming from?

231
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:46,021
You do so much for me all the time.

232
00:46:46,021 --> 00:46:47,811
I just want to do the same for you.

233
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:53,310
Do you remember how scared you got just
from seeing me talking to Audrina?

234
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,240
But everything is different now.

235
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:56,970
I don't care.

236
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:06,110
I'm not willing to risk losing
you over something I don't need.

237
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,280
But you won't lose me.

238
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:17,360
(Two years into my relationship with Audrina,)

239
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:22,040
we had a very similar conversation
just like this.

240
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:28,090
And she sounded just as confident as you do now.

241
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:36,999
I think it would be fun.

242
00:47:37,950 --> 00:47:39,560
And why's that?

243
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:42,479
What man doesn't want
to be with another woman?

244
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:45,359
Keep pleasuring yourself.

245
00:47:46,359 --> 00:47:47,879
Who did you have in mind?

246
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,660
She's called Rebecca.

247
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:52,710
I know her from my old job.

248
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,540
And what is it about her?

249
00:47:56,121 --> 00:47:58,101
It's her face.

250
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:02,830
It's what i picture every
time I fantasize about you...

251
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,870
...having sex with another woman.

252
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,440
You've done that?

253
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,660
I'm doing it right now.

254
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:14,000
Thinking about you inside of her.

255
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,110
I want to earn that reward.

256
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,890
I mean you please another woman.

257
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,280
Let's have you earn this one too.

258
00:48:27,050 --> 00:48:29,360
No coming till I say so.

259
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,160
Did you ever go through with it?

260
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:37,500
Yes.

261
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:55,470
You ready for this?

262
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:57,910
I can't wait.

263
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,720
Alright Rebecca, you can come in.

264
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:09,589
Get on all fours on the bed.

265
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,689
Pull your dress up.

266
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:23,149
Pull your panties down.

267
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:31,039
I don't want you to take your
eyes off of us for a second.

268
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:35,269
Spread your legs wider.

269
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,370
Oh my god that feels so good, yes...

270
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,370
Stay right there.

271
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:48,670
Audrina!

272
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,920
Right here.
Stay with us.

273
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:22,570
Good choice Audrina.

274
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:25,870
Very good.

275
00:56:52,750 --> 00:56:54,380
Audrina.

276
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:11,280
Please don't tease me, sir.

277
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:17,289
Good, she's calling me "sir"
without even asking.

278
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:15,290
She's got great hands, Audrina.

279
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:31,329
Rebecca.

280
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,130
Yes sir.

281
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:34,990
I want you to walk over,

282
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:37,970
and give Audrina a kiss.

283
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:40,660
- Okay?
- Yes sir.

284
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:55,340
Do you like the way his
cock tastes on my lips?

285
01:02:04,839 --> 01:02:07,919
Audrina, you're the only one
for me. You know that?

286
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:10,520
I love you.

287
01:02:54,169 --> 01:02:56,809
Audrina thank you so much.

288
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:01,359
I had no idea it was gonna
be this much fun.

289
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:04,560
It could have been a...

290
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:07,560
...intensely satisfying experience for both of us.

291
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:10,969
Why wasn't it?

292
01:06:13,359 --> 01:06:16,799
Because I got selfish,

293
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:20,200
and I didn't realize at the time...

294
01:06:20,319 --> 01:06:22,869
...that it was really bothering her.

295
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:28,429
And she wanted to go back to a
more traditional relationship.

296
01:06:29,250 --> 01:06:32,200
- But I would never want that.
- I know.

297
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:35,530
That doesn't change the fact that...

298
01:06:35,530 --> 01:06:37,251
It's not worth it to me...

299
01:06:37,359 --> 01:06:39,329
...to jeopardize what we have.

300
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:42,860
Although he seemed adamant about it now,

301
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:44,750
I knew one day,

302
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:46,800
when the time was right,

303
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:49,250
I'd prove to him that his fantasies

304
01:06:49,250 --> 01:06:50,990
were my fantasies.

305
01:06:50,990 --> 01:06:54,160
And that I was open to absolutely everything.

306
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:12,310
What would you like me to
bring you from Los Angeles?

307
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:15,610
Do you remember that chocolate shop
down the street from us?

308
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:17,450
Yes I do.

309
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:20,760
You can bring me a few treats
from there, I'd really love it.

310
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:22,530
I'll bring you a whole box of those.

311
01:07:22,530 --> 01:07:24,380
- Yeah?
- Yes.

312
01:07:28,150 --> 01:07:29,310
Now...

313
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:33,320
I left tomorrow's outfit hanging in the bathroom.

314
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:36,240
And don't think that just because I'm gone

315
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:37,970
that you get three days off.

316
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:39,300
I know.

317
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:40,709
No masturbating.

318
01:07:40,709 --> 01:07:42,079
The whole time?

319
01:07:42,079 --> 01:07:43,629
You'll survive!

320
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,600
This is so not fair.

321
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:51,630
It's not supposed to be fair.

322
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:29,389
Hello?

323
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:31,840
Emma?

324
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:33,930
Yes. Who's this?

325
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:36,740
It's Kelsey from the corporate office.

326
01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:41,419
Emma, I just got word that William Frederick

327
01:08:41,419 --> 01:08:43,889
was killed in a plane crash this evening.

328
01:08:44,799 --> 01:08:46,799
They're saying it was engine failure or

329
01:08:46,799 --> 01:08:48,519
something like that. I...

330
01:08:50,159 --> 01:08:53,199
I don't have any other details, but, I...

331
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:57,460
I'm so sorry Emma...

332
01:08:58,799 --> 01:09:00,149
Thank you for letting me...

333
01:09:00,650 --> 01:09:02,588
Thank you for letting me know.

334
01:09:18,239 --> 01:09:22,000
Reports are saying the engine failure
was responsible for the plane crash.

335
01:09:22,159 --> 01:09:24,759
Although investigation is still underway.

336
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:27,300
The three passengers have been identified as

337
01:09:27,300 --> 01:09:29,190
pilot John Bennett,

338
01:09:29,190 --> 01:09:31,440
co-pilot Andrew Rogers,

339
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:33,550
and billionaire William Frederick.

340
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:35,990
Frederick was well-known philanthropist and

341
01:09:35,990 --> 01:09:38,860
a highly respected member
of the Atlanta community.

342
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:42,359
His contributions to medical
research included

343
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:44,319
the funding of the downtown Polaria
children's cancer center earlier this year.

344
01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:49,329
He was 35.

345
01:09:51,199 --> 01:09:53,369
For days I just sat there.

346
01:09:53,700 --> 01:09:57,400
Unable to comprehend what life
even meant without him.

347
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:05,730
(Emma, bring me the black tie.)

348
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:05,920
It took almost a week

349
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:08,920
before I could even take off the final
outfit he'd chosen for me to wear.

350
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,610
I didn't want to accept
there would never be another.

351
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:25,040
Or that the world he and I had created

352
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:26,719
over the last several years

353
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:29,159
had now become nothing more than a memory.

354
01:11:32,719 --> 01:11:34,979
And that this journey we had embarked upon,

355
01:11:34,979 --> 01:11:37,979
had come to the most bittersweet of ends.

356
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:56,159
I stayed with Nadia and Ray for a while

357
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:58,409
when I got back to the west coast.

358
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:01,040
It was a world that I'd evolved so far from,

359
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:03,420
that it was hard to be in the thick of it again.

360
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:06,358
All that brightness and sterile wealth.

361
01:12:08,159 --> 01:12:09,679
They both did everything within their

362
01:12:09,679 --> 01:12:11,557
power to try and fix me.

363
01:12:12,239 --> 01:12:16,189
Hey, I made you some brownies.
I know they're your favorite.

364
01:12:17,679 --> 01:12:19,518
I'm not really hungry.

365
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,232
Okay.

366
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:32,237
I don't know why you just didn't listen to me.

367
01:12:32,237 --> 01:12:35,050
Like I told you, Emma doesn't like flowers.

368
01:12:35,050 --> 01:12:36,736
Oh my god.

369
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:40,100
- All women are flower people.
- No.

370
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:43,354
Emma isn't. She's not like every person.

371
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:45,199
I spent all this time picking this out,

372
01:12:45,199 --> 01:12:46,960
you could have let me know ahead of time.

373
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:47,359
I did, but ...

374
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:51,778
But nothing could distract me away
from the painful reality of the situation.

375
01:12:53,199 --> 01:12:55,936
I would never see Mr Frederick again.

376
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,490
Remember when we used to do this all the time?

377
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,628
You may not see it now but...

378
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:35,357
Life has its reasons...

379
01:13:35,852 --> 01:13:37,521
Even for heartbreak.

380
01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:52,736
I wonder who I'd be if I never met you.

381
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:55,543
Be you.

382
01:13:56,750 --> 01:13:58,765
That's not what I mean.

383
01:13:59,199 --> 01:14:02,403
Emma, this was in you before me.

384
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:06,670
I could tell that the second I met you.

385
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:11,551
It'll be a part of who you are forever.

386
01:14:39,679 --> 01:14:42,289
To a life of hope and promise.

387
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:49,923
- Too hot?
- Yeah.

388
01:14:50,311 --> 01:14:52,043
Well it has some cleansing properties,

389
01:14:52,043 --> 01:14:55,043
so you want to make sure to finish it.

390
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,224
We could all use some cleansing around here.

391
01:15:00,239 --> 01:15:03,281
So, I was thinking we can
take a day trip this morning.

392
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:05,729
I don't think Emma wants to go on a day trip.

393
01:15:05,900 --> 01:15:07,050
Of course she does.

394
01:15:07,050 --> 01:15:08,775
Everybody likes a day trip.

395
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,394
Okay, where are we going?

396
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:12,159
Palm Springs!

397
01:15:12,500 --> 01:15:13,688
Golfing?

398
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:15,916
No. No golfing Ray.

399
01:15:15,916 --> 01:15:17,535
This is family bonding.

400
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:19,845
They have this place called "paint a memory".

401
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:22,747
We can go and paint some ceramics, and...

402
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:22,968
(Why?)

403
01:15:23,750 --> 01:15:25,974
Because it's something we can do together.

404
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,727
Something we've never done before.

405
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:30,983
(I have a new task for you today.)

406
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:33,237
Something we've never done before.

407
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:36,741
Something we've never done before?

408
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:39,567
A little role reversal.

409
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:41,976
Okay...

410
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:44,562
You are going to be the dominant.

411
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:46,440
Are you serious?

412
01:15:46,986 --> 01:15:50,478
Amidst the chaos of Ray
and Nadia's suburban crisis.

413
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:53,960
Memories of Mr Frederick pulled
me back to that life,

414
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:55,463
that world.

415
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:58,532
Now you can make any demand
of me that you want,

416
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:01,289
- within reason of course.
- Oh my gosh!

417
01:16:01,289 --> 01:16:03,050
I never thought that you would ever come...

418
01:16:03,050 --> 01:16:04,210
But, however,

419
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:06,866
there will be consequences

420
01:16:06,866 --> 01:16:09,601
if you do not convincingly fulfill this role.

421
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:12,210
No asking for permission,

422
01:16:12,210 --> 01:16:14,500
I want you to establish authority,

423
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:15,600
and be assertive.

424
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:19,505
Now i am giving you this
freedom until 10 pm tonight.

425
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:22,283
At which point you'll be stripped of this power,

426
01:16:22,283 --> 01:16:24,427
and you'll return to your role as my submissive.

427
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:28,211
Your time begins...

428
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:30,178
now.

429
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:36,852
Why do we even have to do it at all?

430
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:37,918
Because it's something...

431
01:16:37,918 --> 01:16:39,572
I tried to stay present.

432
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:41,600
But my mind kept drifting back to that

433
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:44,200
last day i spent with Mr Frederick.

434
01:16:44,239 --> 01:16:46,512
Yeah, I mean, but she doesn't. She's like...

435
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:09,844
No.

436
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:15,442
I'm sick and tired of you always...

437
01:17:16,239 --> 01:17:19,694
We had reached a new level of
trust in our relationship that day.

438
01:17:26,850 --> 01:17:28,898
- No please...
- ***

439
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:33,269
But it's different for a guy.

440
01:17:34,239 --> 01:17:36,424
And no masturbating either.

441
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:43,263
Like in some inexplicable way,

442
01:17:43,263 --> 01:17:46,263
we knew that this would be
our final day together.

443
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:50,619
And that we wanted to write
one last epic chapter.

444
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:31,370
What is this?

445
01:18:31,700 --> 01:18:33,404
Your final task.

446
01:18:35,679 --> 01:18:36,931
Wait here.

447
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:47,500
I want to prove to you

448
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:50,500
that what we have is different

449
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:52,529
than anything you've had before.

450
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,573
Emma, no...

451
01:18:55,573 --> 01:18:57,409
Let me give this to you.

452
01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:00,708
It's as much for me as it is for you.

453
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:04,459
All right, but... Emma...

454
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:08,459
I'm in control of your choices tonight.
Remember?

455
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:21,348
Have a little faith in me.

456
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:34,145
Just sit...

457
01:19:36,159 --> 01:19:37,932
and watch.

458
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:22,454
- Do you like what you see?
- Yeah.

459
01:21:26,239 --> 01:21:28,401
My tongue feels so good.

460
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:51,437
Take it easy, mister.

461
01:21:51,437 --> 01:21:54,341
Do remember that I'm in control tonight.

462
01:21:54,341 --> 01:21:55,960
Yeah, one more hour.

463
01:22:11,199 --> 01:22:13,689
Just watch for now.

464
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:53,908
Is this in your *** Mr Frederick?

465
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:55,350
Yes Madam.

466
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:00,382
That's what I like to hear.

467
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:06,232
Oh, I think you should come taste this.

468
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:15,931
Taste her lips first.

469
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:45,312
I want you to taste the rest of her.

470
01:23:56,982 --> 01:23:58,616
Is he doing a good job?

471
01:23:58,586 --> 01:24:00,941
***

472
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:13,720
Make her come with your mouth.

473
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:18,782
Hear her feel all the
pleasure that you give me.

474
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:26,170
Don't you think she
deserves to come ***?

475
01:26:04,239 --> 01:26:05,828
Do it slowly.

476
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:33,292
I just want you to feel her mouth,

477
01:26:33,679 --> 01:26:35,800
I don't want you to feel anything else.

478
01:26:38,239 --> 01:26:40,589
- Do you like to feel the back of her throat?
- Yes

479
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:50,697
It's such a huge turn on
watching her suck your dick.

480
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,321
Do you like that?

481
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:14,649
I'll let you taste this too.

482
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:26,714
That's what i like to hear.

483
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:36,589
We're making our pussies so wet.

484
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:42,261
I think that's where dick needs to go next.

485
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:50,613
Do you like having two girls?

486
01:29:56,400 --> 01:29:59,623
I love your hands so much.

487
01:30:22,807 --> 01:30:25,520
Her lips look so good around your dick.

488
01:30:51,199 --> 01:30:53,880
I want to see what your dick
looks like inside of her.

489
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:05,801
She's such a good girl.

490
01:33:03,450 --> 01:33:05,305
*** come now,

491
01:33:06,320 --> 01:33:08,230
you better make sure you ask permission.

492
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,021
I wanna taste her cum of here.

493
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:09,178
I love watching her swallow your dick.

494
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:17,823
See how much fun we can have.

495
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:19,600
I guess you're right.

496
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:28,115
- I'm sorry that I ***
- I love you so much.

497
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:48,039
- Don't forget to ask for permission...
- Yes madam.

498
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:54,492
Stick that dick inside her.

499
01:38:09,199 --> 01:38:10,743
Such a good girl.

500
01:38:28,239 --> 01:38:30,218
I need to taste it.

501
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:50,743
- You like having two girls servicing you, ***?
- Yes I do.

502
01:39:20,560 --> 01:39:23,680
Now I want you to sit on his face.

503
01:39:24,639 --> 01:39:27,602
And you, I want you lick her pussy.

504
01:39:38,480 --> 01:39:41,121
I want you to use both of that holes.

505
01:39:43,040 --> 01:39:44,793
Stick it way down at me.

506
01:39:50,080 --> 01:39:52,844
You are not very obedient.

507
01:39:52,844 --> 01:39:55,129
That ***.

508
01:40:36,400 --> 01:40:38,064
I love watching that...

509
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:53,398
- Focus.
- Yes baby.

510
01:40:57,760 --> 01:40:59,577
Fuck me first.

511
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:17,125
Just like that.

512
01:43:35,600 --> 01:43:37,225
We don't want to be punished.

513
01:44:34,810 --> 01:44:37,810
No coming without permission.

514
01:45:30,560 --> 01:45:32,615
Just a ***, just a ***...

515
01:46:35,200 --> 01:46:37,449
- Is it ok if I come?
- Yes

516
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:39,197
Yes, you may.

517
01:47:30,350 --> 01:47:34,900
I want you to put all your cum all
over her perfect little tits.

518
01:47:34,900 --> 01:47:36,481
- Yeah?
- Hm-hm

519
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:39,547
Can you do that for me?

520
01:47:39,600 --> 01:47:42,551
Can you be a good boy and
come all over this little slut?

521
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:30,212
I want you to come.

522
01:48:32,320 --> 01:48:35,064
I want you to come all over these tits.

523
01:49:40,239 --> 01:49:44,224
Look at that, it's 10 p.m and
I feel like punishing you.

524
01:49:45,280 --> 01:49:47,051
I didn't do so good?

525
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,100
I'm about to leave town,

526
01:49:50,249 --> 01:49:51,570
and you do this to me.

527
01:49:52,850 --> 01:49:54,718
It was bad?

528
01:49:55,280 --> 01:49:56,697
It was incredible.

529
01:49:57,154 --> 01:49:58,313
You're incredible.

530
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:10,406
Emma? Emma?

531
01:50:11,280 --> 01:50:13,485
Were you listening to
anything I just said?

532
01:50:13,250 --> 01:50:14,600
Of course.

533
01:50:14,639 --> 01:50:16,456
Okay, so paint a memory.

534
01:50:23,599 --> 01:50:26,225
Things were difficult for a really long time.

535
01:50:26,639 --> 01:50:28,639
Memories of Mr Frederick were always

536
01:50:28,639 --> 01:50:30,455
there, just beneath the surface.

537
01:50:30,800 --> 01:50:33,199
Robbing me of the present, and holding me

538
01:50:33,199 --> 01:50:35,407
to something that no longer was.

539
01:51:02,719 --> 01:51:04,800
But the point to all this hasn't been to

540
01:51:04,800 --> 01:51:08,474
tell you about the epic love story
of Emma and Mr Frederick.

541
01:51:09,360 --> 01:51:11,722
It's to tell you the story of my life.

542
01:51:12,159 --> 01:51:14,230
And all of its new beginnings.

543
01:51:30,880 --> 01:51:35,671
I continued on my journey as a submissive
two years after Mr Frederick died.

544
01:51:36,639 --> 01:51:38,984
I couldn't deny my own truth.

545
01:51:39,760 --> 01:51:42,986
Mike Mr Frederick said it was ingrained in me.

546
01:51:44,639 --> 01:51:47,729
So I reached out to a dominant
named Michael Sullivan.

547
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:50,200
I told him about my grief,

548
01:51:50,250 --> 01:51:53,637
and he suggested using BDSM
as a way to heal my pain.

549
01:52:00,719 --> 01:52:03,199
It began as a therapeutic relationship,

550
01:52:03,199 --> 01:52:06,758
in which I paid him to dominate
me a few hours every week.

551
01:52:07,679 --> 01:52:10,410
Easing me back into that familiar world.

552
01:52:18,480 --> 01:52:21,090
Everything we did was an exercise in trust.

553
01:52:22,159 --> 01:52:24,320
We never drafted up a formal contract

554
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:26,480
because initially I had no idea were my

555
01:52:26,480 --> 01:52:28,840
hard-nose even existed anymore.

556
01:52:29,840 --> 01:52:34,103
Sometimes they manifested themselves
in the most unexpected places.

557
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:07,450
But he took things slowly,

558
01:53:07,450 --> 01:53:11,080
allowing me as much time as I needed
to surrender to the experience.

559
01:53:25,199 --> 01:53:28,274
He toyed with new ways of building
up my level of restraint.

560
01:53:28,400 --> 01:53:31,000
Pushing me just to the edge of my breaking point.

561
01:53:31,599 --> 01:53:32,950
But i never broke.

562
01:53:42,960 --> 01:53:45,119
I was determined to overcome the fear

563
01:53:45,119 --> 01:53:47,297
that came from trusting someone new.

564
01:53:50,639 --> 01:53:54,199
No matter how intense the situation or the pain.

565
01:53:57,040 --> 01:53:58,062
What is that?

566
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:01,728
It's an electric wand.

567
01:54:03,360 --> 01:54:04,580
Will it hurt?

568
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,788
The fear of it is going to be
more intense than the actual pain.

569
01:54:11,440 --> 01:54:12,721
And just remember:

570
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:15,596
pain can be a pleasure.

571
01:54:43,360 --> 01:54:47,063
He had this uncanny way of knowing
exactly when to push me.

572
01:54:47,599 --> 01:54:49,274
And when to back down.

573
01:54:54,080 --> 01:54:56,080
And was sensitive to the process in ways

574
01:54:56,080 --> 01:54:57,920
I never would have imagined from someone

575
01:54:57,920 --> 01:54:59,486
I was just beginning to know.

576
01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:10,220
But no matter how sensitive
he might have been,

577
01:55:11,119 --> 01:55:15,000
Nothing would have prepared me for one
particular day we spent together

578
01:55:16,239 --> 01:55:18,465
Today's exercise is an eye contact.

579
01:55:19,920 --> 01:55:21,738
That's not BDSM.

580
01:55:23,280 --> 01:55:24,509
Of course it is.

581
01:55:24,938 --> 01:55:27,519
It's an exercise that pushes
you beyond your comfort zone.

582
01:55:28,960 --> 01:55:31,149
I'd rather be just stick to the physical things.

583
01:55:33,520 --> 01:55:36,191
Being submissive is not just about the physical.

584
01:55:36,550 --> 01:55:37,814
You know that.

585
01:55:40,700 --> 01:55:41,918
Listen,

586
01:55:42,500 --> 01:55:44,663
All I'm asking for is 30 seconds.

587
01:55:45,520 --> 01:55:48,707
For 30 seconds you have
to stare at me in the eyes.

588
01:55:49,360 --> 01:55:51,306
You can count each and every one in your head.

589
01:55:52,400 --> 01:55:53,848
But you can't look away.

590
01:55:54,719 --> 01:55:57,320
I don't understand what this is supposed to teach me.

591
01:55:57,320 --> 01:55:58,886
Is this a hard no?

592
01:56:01,599 --> 01:56:02,490
No.

593
01:56:10,960 --> 01:56:12,482
Then we can begin when you're ready.

594
01:56:20,159 --> 01:56:21,890
There's a lot of courage in what you've done.

595
01:56:22,200 --> 01:56:24,503
Most people would have just rolled over.

596
01:56:25,040 --> 01:56:26,229
I'm ready.

597
01:57:48,320 --> 01:57:51,675
Nobody could ever fill the
void of Mr Frederick's loss.

598
01:57:52,480 --> 01:57:53,960
He was my first love.

599
01:57:54,434 --> 01:57:56,905
And in some ways he was my greatest love.

600
01:57:58,159 --> 01:58:00,177
But he wasn't my only love.

601
01:58:46,320 --> 01:58:49,129
Take off your shoes, get on the bed.

602
01:59:05,599 --> 01:59:07,003
Come here.

603
01:59:16,880 --> 01:59:18,414
I'm scared.

604
01:59:20,880 --> 01:59:22,541
Well you have every right to be.

605
01:59:26,880 --> 01:59:28,658
What if I can't do this?

606
01:59:30,639 --> 01:59:32,641
Then use your safe word.

607
01:59:35,280 --> 01:59:37,483
What's bringing on all these concerns.

608
01:59:40,960 --> 01:59:43,063
I'm afraid I might like it.

609
01:59:45,520 --> 01:59:47,282
That's kind of the point.

610
02:00:31,040 --> 02:00:34,254
Stop. You're beautiful.

611
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,892
When I think back on the last 10 years of my life,

612
02:01:13,599 --> 02:01:16,593
I'm overcome with a profound sense of happiness,

613
02:01:17,119 --> 02:01:20,541
the road I traveled to get to where I'm at right now.

614
02:01:20,960 --> 02:01:22,880
A strong, courageous, woman who's no

615
02:01:22,880 --> 02:01:25,758
longer living this socially acceptable existence.

616
02:01:26,239 --> 02:01:28,322
But one who's found her truth,

617
02:01:28,750 --> 02:01:30,604
fallen in love with that truth.

618
02:01:30,800 --> 02:01:33,765
And become the person she was always meant to be.

619
02:01:34,550 --> 02:01:35,498
Sure,

620
02:01:35,650 --> 02:01:38,135
life didn't work out as I might have imagined.

621
02:01:38,800 --> 02:01:40,932
Life never happens perfectly.

622
02:01:41,520 --> 02:01:45,239
There are often setbacks and challenges and
frustrations and heartbreak.

623
02:01:46,080 --> 02:01:47,960
But as Nadia once said,

624
02:01:48,550 --> 02:01:51,323
There is reason. Even for heartbreak.

625
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:53,281
And this was mine.

626
02:01:58,960 --> 02:02:02,296
We all play roles and wear
masks from time to time.

627
02:02:02,800 --> 02:02:05,817
It's what we do.
It's how we get by.

628
02:02:06,400 --> 02:02:09,602
Sometimes it's to make ourselves
feel good about ourselves.

629
02:02:12,719 --> 02:02:18,250
Sometimes it's to fulfill that inner need
we have to be something we're actually not.

630
02:02:24,960 --> 02:02:28,247
And then there are those times
when your guard is down,

631
02:02:28,719 --> 02:02:30,443
and that mask comes off.

632
02:02:34,880 --> 02:02:36,624
When your heart is open,

633
02:02:36,817 --> 02:02:40,530
and the only thought is of this one
precious moment.

634
02:02:41,280 --> 02:02:42,346
And you're left beautifully,

635
02:02:42,880 --> 02:02:46,629
perfectly, comfortably, exposed.

636
02:06:09,679 --> 02:06:11,638
Hold it in place.

637
02:08:05,599 --> 02:08:06,939
There you go.

638
02:10:04,239 --> 02:10:05,995
I think you're ready for the real thing.

639
02:10:05,920 --> 02:10:08,343
Oh yes please fuck me.

640
02:15:04,639 --> 02:15:05,915
Give you one hand.

641
02:20:20,080 --> 02:20:21,383
You should turn around.

642
02:25:37,840 --> 02:25:39,883
I like that.

643
02:33:58,399 --> 02:34:02,136
One day, when I'm ready,

644
02:34:03,840 --> 02:34:05,959
a while from now,

645
02:34:07,120 --> 02:34:09,074
I'd like to tell you my story,

646
02:34:09,500 --> 02:34:11,299
and how I got here.

647
02:34:13,680 --> 02:34:15,301
I'd like to hear that.

648
02:34:22,640 --> 02:34:27,041
And what would this life story be called?

649
02:34:31,680 --> 02:34:34,261
The Submission of Emma Marx.
