00:04:54,176 --> 00:04:55,526

and there's the body found,
on 'taikon the rubber street'.

21
00:05:00,085 --> 00:05:01,109
How do you spell
"taikon arogan"?

22
00:05:02,337 --> 00:05:03,453
Oh you don't know either.

23
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:06,205
I tell you what, drag the body down
the first street and call me back.

24

Come on in.

00:05:11,363 --> 00:05:12,765
Sam: Hi 'Tits', what can we do you for?

00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:15,411

Have a sit right over here.

31
00:05:29,623 --> 00:05:30,862
So...

32
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:32,966
Are you two as good,
as the paper say?

33
00:05:33,668 --> 00:05:34,805
Are you kidding Lady!

34
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:38,216
He's got more talent in his entire body,
then you got in your little finger.

35
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:40,459
Come over here.

36
00:05:40,812 --> 00:05:42,303
What?
Sam: Come over here.

37
00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:47,979
You see this, there's
one to another one.

38
00:05:48,004 --> 00:05:48,977
Now go sit down.

39
00:05:49,928 --> 00:05:50,990
Gentleman!

40
00:05:51,706 --> 00:05:52,872
Roscoe:
Somebody come in?

41
00:05:53,504 --> 00:05:54,763
'Tits':
I need your help.

42
00:05:55,043 --> 00:05:58,126
Sam:
Sit down, keep your shirt on. Lets hear it.

43
00:05:58,151 --> 00:06:01,681
My name is Joan McTavish and a month
ago my grandfather

44
00:06:01,697 --> 00:06:04,330
Lord Angus McAngus has passed away.

45
00:06:04,978 --> 00:06:07,482
He left my sister Patty and I property
in Scotland.

46
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:10,724
I got property in Las Vegas.
You know that?

47
00:06:12,631 --> 00:06:14,593
What property do you have in
Las Vegas?

48
00:06:15,142 --> 00:06:16,677
Caesar's palace has my luggage.

49
00:06:17,629 --> 00:06:19,315
Come over here.
Roscoe: What?

50
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,765
Come over here.
Roscoe: You ain't gonna hit me, are you?

51
00:06:20,816 --> 00:06:21,916
- No, no, no.
- Are you sure?

52
00:06:22,864 --> 00:06:24,948
Stereo, go sit down.

53
00:06:24,973 --> 00:06:26,341
Gentlemen, please...

54
00:06:26,539 --> 00:06:28,716
You keep your skirt on,
please.

55
00:06:30,091 --> 00:06:31,127
Go on.

56
00:06:31,152 --> 00:06:32,019
What you see

57
00:06:32,245 --> 00:06:33,946
according to my grandfather's will

58
00:06:34,196 --> 00:06:36,444
if my sister doesn't sign
the proper documents

59
00:06:36,746 --> 00:06:38,945
to transfer the title of
the castle to her name

60
00:06:38,995 --> 00:06:40,546
within the next 48 hours.

61
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:43,305
The title will be transferred
to my evil uncle

62
00:06:43,496 --> 00:06:45,053
and his wicked wife.

63
00:06:45,078 --> 00:06:47,372
The Earl and Lady McAngus.

64
00:06:47,947 --> 00:06:49,076
So what seems to be the problem?

65
00:06:49,477 --> 00:06:51,111
When I phoned the castle
this morning to see

66
00:06:51,147 --> 00:06:52,798
If my sister had signed the papers.

67
00:06:53,395 --> 00:06:55,393
My evil uncle's attorney had told me

68
00:06:55,546 --> 00:06:57,296
the family hasn't seen her in weeks.

69
00:06:58,147 --> 00:07:00,295
- And well
- Yes

70
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:03,373
'Tits': Well I...
Sam & Roscoe: Yes, yes...

00:07:03,722 --> 00:07:07,121
'Tits': Well I suspect.
Sam & Roscoe: Yes, yes, yes...

72
00:07:08,724 --> 00:07:12,880
- Well I suspect... foul play.
- No...

73
00:07:13,317 --> 00:07:16,318
The next thing you know, you're gonna
be telling us you suspect murder.

74
00:07:17,217 --> 00:07:19,409
Easy, easy, hey...

75
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,486
Well, yes, even murder.

76
00:07:22,161 --> 00:07:23,925
That's why I'm in dire
straits gentlemen.

77
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,785

00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:31,501
Get the door, come on

79
00:07:34,818 --> 00:07:36,271
Sam: Get the door...

00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,351
Oh, Hi Chicks come on in.

81
00:07:40,928 --> 00:07:42,411

00:07:42,861 --> 00:07:45,261
Sam: Hey, hey come on,

Sam: Now listen, you don't

88
00:07:56,775 --> 00:07:59,280
and get some disguises, so we
blend in with the natives.

89
00:07:59,525 --> 00:08:00,875
That's a good thinking Sam.

90
00:08:00,976 --> 00:08:02,274
Yeah and I'll tell you what.

91
00:08:02,425 --> 00:08:05,535

transportation our money can buy.

92

Okay Sammy there's anything I can do?

93
00:08:09,085 --> 00:08:12,135
I want you to go help that Lady over there.

94
00:08:12,224 --> 00:08:14,879
And also mind your own p's and q's.

Ok, Samuel you can count on me.

00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,525
That's what I'm afraid off.

98
00:08:30,206 --> 00:08:31,729
Ok, what can we do you for.

99
00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:38,078
- Well, I think my husband's cheating.

00:08:50,547 --> 00:08:52,739
Oh, Slick Chick, I get it.

So what make you think your
husband is cheating on you?

106
00:08:55,933 --> 00:08:57,669
He hasn't touch this in mouth.

107
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,848
So, how come you haven't tried
forcing yourself on him.

108
00:09:04,548 --> 00:09:05,889
You mean like this.

109
00:10:45,595 --> 00:10:47,012
Don't go anywhere.

110
00:15:26,745 --> 00:15:28,144
Fuck me harder.

00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:33,884
I'm trying

113
00:19:23,239 --> 00:19:25,088
Nah, don't worried about kid,

114
00:19:25,113 --> 00:19:27,132
Looks like a great place
to kill 90 minutes.

115
00:19:59,181 --> 00:20:00,899
All dress up like a well kept grave.

116
00:20:09,254 --> 00:20:10,998
You almost stepped on him.

117
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:13,143
That would've been murder.

118
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:16,417
- Murder!
- Get off.

119
00:20:17,367 --> 00:20:19,567
Listen you're ok... there you go.

120
00:20:20,216 --> 00:20:23,414
Is the Earl and Lady, expecting you?

00:20:23,842 --> 00:20:26,892
Yes, yes you can... tell them...

122
00:20:26,917 --> 00:20:29,112
that the long lost cousins, have arrived.

123
00:20:29,733 --> 00:20:33,181
Those who enter, enter at their only risk.

124
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,180
Hum, it's good.

125
00:20:41,978 --> 00:20:43,694
Go on, go on.

126
00:20:46,226 --> 00:20:46,994
Stay!!!

127
00:20:49,813 --> 00:20:51,847
Here you go kid, here you go.

00:20:52,845 --> 00:20:54,598
Hey what a joint here.

130
00:20:58,133 --> 00:21:06,218
All aboard train leaving to 'Azuzar', 
and I'm accompanying all aboard.

131
00:21:06,249 --> 00:21:09,470
Idiot... this is a castle not a train station

132
00:21:24,849 --> 00:21:26,885
How about another, oh my sweet.

133
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:29,836
It's Benson my lord.

134
00:21:30,585 --> 00:21:32,088
Come right in my good man

135
00:21:39,113 --> 00:21:41,939
There are guests
who wish to see you sir.

136
00:21:42,302 --> 00:21:45,241
They say they are cousins
of the McAngus clan.

137
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,839
Isn't always the case.

138
00:21:49,338 --> 00:21:53,590
Just when you get to the best part.
Interruptions, always interruptions.

139
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:59,850
- My apologies, my bunny laughs.
- That alright my sweet.

140
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:01,999
Show them to the McAngus family room.

141
00:22:02,449 --> 00:22:04,250
Tell them at the present,
I'm all tied up

142
00:22:04,258 --> 00:22:05,815
but I'll join them, shortly.

143
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,611
Very good sir.

144
00:22:13,382 --> 00:22:16,852
- Hello, help, hello.
- Hey, hey, put that down.

145
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:18,802
This could be expense stuff, you know,
don't touch anything.

146
00:22:20,352 --> 00:22:23,150
Hey Sam, I heard... was like...
ghost in castles.

147
00:22:23,253 --> 00:22:24,802
Nah, nonsense kid.

148
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:27,562
Dont't you worried about it.
You got nothing to fear here.

149
00:22:32,064 --> 00:22:34,071
Your Earl, see you presently.

150
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:37,890
You shall wait in
the McAngus room.

151
00:22:37,915 --> 00:22:40,074
It's the family room...

152
00:22:40,099 --> 00:22:41,371
Follow me.

153
00:22:45,712 --> 00:22:49,980
- Hey Sam, is my slip showing?
- I don't know let me check.

154
00:22:50,684 --> 00:22:55,634
Now go on, go on, go on,

155
00:23:01,277 --> 00:23:02,479
Go on.

156
00:23:04,228 --> 00:23:06,276
Wait here.

157
00:23:10,529 --> 00:23:12,438
Hey Sam is this a clue,
what's this?

158
00:23:12,488 --> 00:23:14,438
What you, put this down you idiot.

159
00:23:14,739 --> 00:23:17,249
God, listen what the hell where you,
before you were a private detective.

160
00:23:18,449 --> 00:23:22,449
- I was a "momback".
- What the hell is a "momback"?

161
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,349
One of the guys who stands behind the trucks says...

162
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:29,059
- "momback", "momback".
- Stupid.

163
00:23:29,806 --> 00:23:33,059
Listen, let me speak and , let me speak and  ...

164
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:39,068
Hey Sam look at this, look here.

165
00:23:39,391 --> 00:23:40,406
Don't drink that.

166
00:23:42,049 --> 00:23:42,807
It's raining.

167
00:23:44,557 --> 00:23:45,806
I don't feels so good.

168
00:23:47,554 --> 00:23:48,803
Come over here, come over here.

169
00:24:15,132 --> 00:24:18,975
Gentleman the Earl and Lady McAngus.

170
00:24:24,696 --> 00:24:26,128
So lads.

171
00:24:26,646 --> 00:24:29,421
You're true McAngus Scotsman are you.

172
00:24:29,712 --> 00:24:31,755
It's a black moon, nac, nac tonight.

173
00:24:33,855 --> 00:24:35,506
Nac, dead tonight... tomorrow to.

174
00:24:36,967 --> 00:24:38,686
Let me introduce myself

175
00:24:38,711 --> 00:24:40,830
I'm McSam and this
is my McRoscoe.

176
00:24:41,057 --> 00:24:42,114
- Hi Mc.
- Hi you Mc.

177
00:24:42,115 --> 00:24:44,265
Nice to meet you Mc.
nice to...

178
00:24:45,736 --> 00:24:47,466
Meet the Lady McAngus.

179
00:24:49,038 --> 00:24:50,935
And Albert Frankenstein.

180
00:24:51,188 --> 00:24:53,446
Is an exchange student from Transylvania.

181
00:24:54,444 --> 00:24:55,644
And my niece.

182
00:24:57,046 --> 00:25:00,518
So, 'Lassie'.
What might your name... sorry.

183
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:01,751
What might your name be?

184
00:25:02,352 --> 00:25:04,977
You might have heard of it, it's Lorna Doone.

185
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:08,059
Hi Lorna, how're you doing?

186
00:25:10,095 --> 00:25:13,244
You've a bit of a strange accent
for a Scotsman, don't you?

187
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:16,569
Hum... well where from Southern Scotland.

188
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:19,134
Yah, below the McMason, McDixon line.

189
00:25:21,431 --> 00:25:24,139
So, what do we owe this, fine visit.

190
00:25:24,887 --> 00:25:26,438
Well we're here, on a quest.

191
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:30,211
A quest and search of a long-lost cousin,
Patty McTavish.

192
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:33,451
Oh yes, sweet little Patty.

193
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:35,741
Whatever did happen to Patty?

194
00:25:35,911 --> 00:25:37,785
Earl McAngus:
Hi, it's was a mystery to us.

195
00:25:38,838 --> 00:25:41,136
The last we saw of poor Patty, she went out

196
00:25:41,137 --> 00:25:44,828
to fetch her bottle of scotch and
some batteries for her vibrator.

197
00:25:46,327 --> 00:25:47,828
It was a mystery indeed.

198
00:25:49,378 --> 00:25:50,778
Some say it's for the ghosts.

199
00:25:51,518 --> 00:25:54,520
But we don't believe in such superstitions, do we lads?

200
00:25:55,172 --> 00:25:58,570
Easy, easy, easy...
Easy, easy, I know...

201
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,176
I just, you wouldn't mind

202
00:26:00,201 --> 00:26:01,793
if we happen to search
out this joint thing.

203
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,631
I mean , I guess your wouldn't mind

204
00:26:03,672 --> 00:26:06,380
if McRoscoe and myself, happen to check out this castle.

205
00:26:08,177 --> 00:26:09,753
As a matter of fact lads...

206
00:26:11,629 --> 00:26:13,753
Lorna here, would give you
the grand tour.

207
00:26:15,029 --> 00:26:16,628
Come with me lads.

208
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:21,761
Come on, come on.

209
00:26:29,764 --> 00:26:32,254
I smell a bogus McAngus.

210
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:34,739
In fact I smell two of them.

211
00:26:34,933 --> 00:26:36,863
I don't like this my dear.

212
00:26:36,888 --> 00:26:40,012
We've only 48 hours
until the castle is ours

213
00:26:40,176 --> 00:26:44,287
And I don't want those two bungleling fools ruin for us.

214
00:26:45,447 --> 00:26:49,222
Benson, call the family
lawyers straight away.

215
00:26:49,589 --> 00:26:52,745
- Tell him, to come here immediately.
- Yes my Lord.

216
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:56,715
Don't worry my Lady, I've a plan.

217
00:26:57,715 --> 00:26:58,715
You always do.

218
00:26:59,813 --> 00:27:06,237
This is the McAngus castle,
it as been standing for 700 years

219
00:27:06,262 --> 00:27:10,498
but they firm hand,
of the McAngus ruling within

220
00:27:10,523 --> 00:27:17,597
but this lads, their has being
50 generations of McAngusus

221
00:27:17,622 --> 00:27:22,059
leaving and dying within these walls.

222
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:27,409
Well, why even my
great-grandfather

223
00:27:27,459 --> 00:27:31,319
murdered himself, by
hanging from the chandelier.

224
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:35,569
In the 13th century.

225
00:27:36,219 --> 00:27:41,644
Catherine McAngus,
 beheaded by her husband Henry.

226
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:44,994
There has been a McAngus here,
through the dark ages

227
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:47,995
there has been, a McAngus here
 through the crusades

228
00:27:48,494 --> 00:27:51,054
and when Columbus was
finding the new world

229
00:27:51,205 --> 00:27:52,705
there was a McAngus here

230
00:27:53,106 --> 00:27:57,856
and through the two great wars,
there was also a McAngus here.

231
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,255
I guess, you could say, there
is a McAngus among us.

232
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,528
Shut up

233
00:28:03,082 --> 00:28:06,436
But now, my grandfather
has done the unspeakable.

234
00:28:06,937 --> 00:28:12,500
He has left the McAngus castle,
to a McTavish, in his own will.

235
00:28:12,786 --> 00:28:17,996
Which has brought upon the
wrath, of 15 generations

236
00:28:18,296 --> 00:28:22,798
of ghosts of the McAngus
upon the castle.

237
00:28:23,203 --> 00:28:28,056
Lads, be afraid, be very afraid.

238
00:28:32,027 --> 00:28:34,526
- I'm scared Sam.
- Hey listen, come on.

239
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,378
What are you superstitious?
Come on.

240
00:28:36,403 --> 00:28:37,375
What're you, a man or a mouse?

241
00:28:38,227 --> 00:28:40,527
Put a piece of cheese on
the floor and find out.

242
00:28:45,639 --> 00:28:48,139
Wait a minute... wait a minute.
Where she go?

243
00:28:48,164 --> 00:28:49,129
Oh great...

244
00:28:49,947 --> 00:28:51,264
Listen.

245
00:28:51,289 --> 00:28:52,751
Come with me, come with me.

246
00:28:52,865 --> 00:28:54,915
Don't go...
This way, this way, come on.

247
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:03,462
If you don't mind.

248
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:06,908
I think I retired to study my
great-grandfathers experiments.

249
00:29:08,259 --> 00:29:10,620
Not at all lad,
not at all, not at all.

250
00:29:11,157 --> 00:29:12,308
Goodnight then.

251
00:29:24,782 --> 00:29:26,184
Go on, go on.

252
00:29:30,234 --> 00:29:33,830
- Hey Seamus, is this a clue?
- No, it's not a clue.

253
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,792
This is... mini bone dog biscuits.

254
00:29:37,992 --> 00:29:39,543
Oh sure, looks like lunch to me.

255
00:29:41,193 --> 00:29:42,804
Hey, hey, hey, don't eat that.

256
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,651
- Why ?
- That's not for human consumption.

257
00:29:53,815 --> 00:29:57,049
Oh no, no again.

258
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:11,406
- Who Is that?
- It's ok kiddo.

259
00:30:11,956 --> 00:30:13,756
It's probably... the call of the wolf.

260
00:30:14,267 --> 00:30:15,364
Well I can do that.

261
00:30:15,889 --> 00:30:17,714
- What're you talking about?
- You know.

262
00:30:19,416 --> 00:30:20,225
Hey baby.

263
00:30:20,715 --> 00:30:22,413
Yeah I'll tell you...

264
00:30:22,438 --> 00:30:25,165
Now get out of here.
I want to check this out.

265
00:30:40,233 --> 00:30:41,585
Now, come here kid,
get me your hand.

266
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:49,563
And quit your shoving, come on.

267
00:30:50,917 --> 00:30:51,766
Hey.

268
00:30:54,213 --> 00:30:55,566
When was the last time you shave?

269
00:30:57,425 --> 00:30:58,375
What about a dentist?

270
00:30:59,226 --> 00:31:01,227
Man, I got two words for you
with that breath, tic tac...

271
00:32:05,923 --> 00:32:07,773
Kid, kid, quick come here.

272
00:32:09,024 --> 00:32:12,133
Listen, it's ok, it's ok listen.
That crazy man....

273
00:32:12,158 --> 00:32:13,988
We've to go down and
warn the others ok.

274
00:32:14,034 --> 00:32:18,534
Come here.
Sam & Roscoe: Mad dog, mad dog...

275
00:32:19,124 --> 00:32:21,707
Well Earl, I think you've
been a bit too worried.

276
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:25,157
These documents show you the
castle and all of its contents

277
00:32:25,182 --> 00:32:27,628
to be legally yours,
after 24 hours

278
00:32:27,653 --> 00:32:31,690
and that's due to a default on
the part of this Patty McTavish.

279
00:32:31,768 --> 00:32:33,765
Do you think, she'll still
be missing tomorrow?

280
00:32:34,322 --> 00:32:35,904
You can count on it.

281
00:32:36,753 --> 00:32:40,553
Ok, you can do with your...
McAngus impersonated.

282
00:32:40,691 --> 00:32:42,914
how *** you like, have a
little importance to us

283
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:49,665
Mad dog, mad dog.

284
00:32:50,164 --> 00:32:51,414
I'm telling you at all.

285
00:32:51,439 --> 00:32:54,222
It was scary, it was hairy,
it had sharp hard teeth.

286
00:32:58,175 --> 00:33:01,675
I think these lads have had
a wee too bit much scotch.

287
00:33:06,806 --> 00:33:07,985
My lord.

288
00:33:10,936 --> 00:33:11,936
Yes Benson.

289
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:15,409
The Constable Rain,
he says that the bridge

290
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:20,193
connect the road to village,
they washed away.

291
00:33:21,994 --> 00:33:24,602
So I'm afraid nobody
will be leaving tonight.

292
00:33:24,702 --> 00:33:27,051
- Ah Sam
- it's ok.

293
00:33:27,959 --> 00:33:33,258
How strange bit of events it is.
Some which call it a curse.

294
00:33:34,293 --> 00:33:37,308
Others which call it, coincidence.

295
00:33:38,912 --> 00:33:42,019
However enough talk,
it's getting late.

296
00:33:42,268 --> 00:33:44,821
Benson's show these lads
to their rooms now.

297
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,044
Yes my lord.

298
00:33:47,245 --> 00:33:48,294
McFleecem [lawyer]:
Do you think it's wise

299
00:33:48,295 --> 00:33:49,845
that you let them
spend the night here.

300
00:33:50,696 --> 00:33:53,046
A lot can happen before
the sun rises

301
00:33:53,071 --> 00:33:54,144
over the bonny bay.

302
00:33:56,442 --> 00:34:00,053
Lorna... show McFleecem into his room now.

303
00:34:08,211 --> 00:34:09,050
No, not this...

304
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:10,260
Where do you go? Go ahead.

305
00:34:19,787 --> 00:34:25,050
You find these very comfortable
on a cold clammy wind blows

306
00:34:25,075 --> 00:34:27,699
over the moors, like a lost soul.

307
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:30,700
- Easy, easy.
- Good night.

308
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:35,607
And if you need
anything just wail

309
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:45,074
Just wail like a lost soul Sam.

310
00:34:47,556 --> 00:34:49,585
I don't want go sleep anymore.

311
00:34:50,169 --> 00:34:51,621
Now put this, this... come on.

312
00:34:59,444 --> 00:35:02,246
You know Lorna,
these shady dealings

313
00:35:02,297 --> 00:35:03,795
that I'm gonna to
take for your family

314
00:35:03,906 --> 00:35:06,904
could cause me, to lose my
license to practice law.

315
00:35:08,305 --> 00:35:10,304
I understand the risks
that you're taking

316
00:35:10,354 --> 00:35:11,953
but we are very grateful.

317
00:35:12,857 --> 00:35:15,966
Well could you show me, some of
that gratitude my bonnie lass.

318
00:35:18,093 --> 00:35:18,947
I think I can.

319
00:35:43,693 --> 00:35:44,947
Oh my!

320
00:35:46,042 --> 00:35:49,117
You're something, something
of a wild one aren't you?

321
00:36:16,626 --> 00:36:17,975
My that's good.

322
00:36:19,025 --> 00:36:20,875
Here darling,

323
00:36:35,766 --> 00:36:39,264
Gentle you can't hurt
this old liar.

324
00:36:51,138 --> 00:36:52,898
Bad girl aren't you?

325
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:31,449
See you like that...

326
00:37:35,323 --> 00:37:37,024
Bad girl aren't you?

327
00:38:06,686 --> 00:38:10,553
Oh my lord, I never seen a
site like that before in my life.

328
00:38:41,803 --> 00:38:44,200
Lean back, let me put it...

329
00:38:52,771 --> 00:38:56,592
Like a deep crevasse, you
just buried it into, isn't it

330
00:39:06,109 --> 00:39:08,359
Oh, look at them,
at the bottom.

331
00:39:30,889 --> 00:39:31,703
Look at me

332
00:39:31,728 --> 00:39:34,002
and slide the thing all
the way down your throat

333
00:39:34,027 --> 00:39:35,272
as far as you can.

334
00:39:38,127 --> 00:39:35,872
Show me your eyes.

335
00:40:12,997 --> 00:40:15,197
Oh, I'm coming after you.

336
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:48,281
Lorna: It's so fucking good.
McFleecem: Oh, your pussy feels...

337
00:40:48,306 --> 00:40:51,982
McFleecem: Feels so fine.
Lorna: Nice and tight.

338
00:40:53,981 --> 00:40:54,981
Yes indeed.

339
00:40:59,639 --> 00:41:01,172
Don't make it come yet.

340
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:03,741
Slide it into me.

341
00:41:08,751 --> 00:41:10,385
Just grind it over my cock like that.

342
00:41:10,748 --> 00:41:11,748
Grind it and rub it.

343
00:41:22,508 --> 00:41:25,393
Oh, I can feel tight around me

344
00:43:12,739 --> 00:43:14,618
Don't make me come yet.

345
00:43:16,888 --> 00:43:18,666
McFleecem:
Spread your legs around and spank it.

346
00:43:55,616 --> 00:43:57,651
Oh darling.

347
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:20,003
Suck it I never seen a more beautiful site my life

348
00:44:56,224 --> 00:44:58,095
McFleecem:
Look at it close like a little butterfly.

349
00:45:53,399 --> 00:45:54,496
Come all over face

350
00:46:05,348 --> 00:46:06,964
Look at my cunt.

351
00:47:11,015 --> 00:47:12,619
McFleecem:
Turn over now.

352
00:47:21,408 --> 00:47:22,578
Fuck my tits

353
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:36,655
Do you want to fuck them.

354
00:47:48,412 --> 00:47:50,995
Come in my face you can do that.

355
00:48:13,903 --> 00:48:15,537
McFleecem:
You want it, you want it Lorna.

356
00:48:47,367 --> 00:48:48,869
You're a wild one.

357
00:48:50,617 --> 00:48:52,044
The moon is full

358
00:48:52,069 --> 00:48:55,154
and the spirits of the
McAngus clan...

359
00:48:55,628 --> 00:48:58,130
Yes and you're a vision
of loveliness my Lass.

360
00:48:59,190 --> 00:49:02,140
Take me quickly and with your
usual force full manner.

361
00:49:24,657 --> 00:49:28,410
- Excuse-me my lord.
- Yes, what is it Benson?

362
00:49:29,158 --> 00:49:32,121
The guest have retired
for the evening.

363
00:49:32,146 --> 00:49:33,787
Do you need anything else?

364
00:49:42,677 --> 00:49:43,877
Benson.

365
00:49:45,878 --> 00:49:46,878
Yes my lord.

366
00:49:52,677 --> 00:49:53,677
Very well.

367
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:31,222
Suck my dick, Lass.

368
00:56:52,557 --> 00:56:54,624
Your turn Benson give it to her.

369
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:31,143
Hi Benson, you take the higher road
 and I'll take the low road.

370
00:57:36,303 --> 00:57:38,318
Oh your ass...

371
00:57:38,343 --> 00:57:41,297
oh feels good, feels so good.

372
01:00:18,449 --> 01:00:20,048
Kid, kid

373
01:00:21,563 --> 01:00:22,548
Come here.

374
01:00:23,199 --> 01:00:24,547
- What?
- Do you see that?

375
01:00:26,556 --> 01:00:27,556
No

376
01:00:30,058 --> 01:00:31,541
No neither do I.

377
01:00:31,566 --> 01:00:33,560
Well go on, wake up
and go back to sleep.

378
01:00:43,766 --> 01:00:45,830
- What the hell was that?
- A termite?

379
01:00:47,630 --> 01:00:49,827
Termite come on let's
go investigated.

380
01:00:54,369 --> 01:00:59,087
I don't know Sam. I'm feeling kind of edgy,
I need to take something for my nerves

381
01:00:59,287 --> 01:01:01,588
- Oh, like what kid?
- Like a trip home.

382
01:01:01,688 --> 01:01:04,006
Hey, hey, come on.
Listen...

383
01:01:06,239 --> 01:01:07,682
Tell you what, why you
go ahead take this gun.

384
01:01:07,948 --> 01:01:09,015
That'll give you protection.

385
01:01:13,849 --> 01:01:16,100
Oh I'm sorry Sam.
Are you ok Sam?

386
01:01:16,408 --> 01:01:18,110
- Sam are you ok?
- I'm ok kid.

387
01:01:18,307 --> 01:01:22,110
Yes, stupid.
Now, go on, go on.

388
01:01:22,810 --> 01:01:23,508
Now let me get this.

389
01:01:25,107 --> 01:01:27,119
And you,
you stay behind.

390
01:01:37,898 --> 01:01:39,339
Let's begin.

391
01:01:39,448 --> 01:01:41,447
Ok, here we go.
Little bit of this.

392
01:01:41,795 --> 01:01:42,946
Oh that's enough.

393
01:01:43,146 --> 01:01:44,448
A little bit of blood.

394
01:01:46,444 --> 01:01:48,244
Alright, give me.

395
01:01:48,363 --> 01:01:49,458
Little bit of body fluid.

396
01:01:51,158 --> 01:01:52,508
I don't know where,
that came from.

397
01:01:55,123 --> 01:01:57,215
I'm missing something.
I'm missing something.

398
01:01:58,032 --> 01:01:58,715
Don't move.

399
01:01:59,968 --> 01:02:01,970
Thank you.
Here we go.

400
01:02:07,064 --> 01:02:10,074
Failure, no, dam it.

401
01:02:14,111 --> 01:02:17,335
Fuck, God damn it!, failure.

402
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:19,655
What kind of shampoo
you're using anyway?

403
01:02:21,285 --> 01:02:24,055
I think I put a little too much deoxyribonucleic acid

404
01:02:24,704 --> 01:02:26,242
Doctor, are you ok?

405
01:02:26,842 --> 01:02:30,492
Well, what's this face tell you?
Nurse: I'd say you're a little upset.

406
01:02:31,747 --> 01:02:33,947
Ulcerated, unhappy, unnerved.

407
01:02:33,997 --> 01:02:35,700
Anything starting with "un",
that's me right now.

408
01:02:35,796 --> 01:02:36,557
I'm furious.

409
01:02:36,951 --> 01:02:37,615
You know, let me tell you something .

410
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:40,898
We can't finish this experiment,
if we don't find the brains of an idiot.

411
01:02:41,607 --> 01:02:44,860
Now, where am I gonna find the brain, of a real moronic type.

412
01:02:54,307 --> 01:02:55,250
- Hey kid.
- What?

413
01:02:56,397 --> 01:02:57,760
- Give me that.
- Oh, I'm sorry Sam.

414
01:02:57,785 --> 01:02:59,310
Listen you're always
causing accidents, you

415
01:02:59,608 --> 01:03:00,759
Come here.
Sit down.

416
01:03:05,317 --> 01:03:08,408
And you wait right there.
I'm gonna go check out this place.

417
01:03:08,849 --> 01:03:09,918
I'm scared Sam.

418
01:03:10,366 --> 01:03:11,266
I tell you what kid.

419
01:03:12,017 --> 01:03:14,019
I know how about this.

420
01:03:14,169 --> 01:03:15,859
Whenever you get scared,
all you've to do,

421
01:03:15,884 --> 01:03:17,841
is say "oh Sam" and
I'll come around, ok...

422
01:03:19,620 --> 01:03:21,678
- Oh Sam.
- What's it.

423
01:03:21,830 --> 01:03:23,529
- What took so long?
- What're you talking about it.

424
01:03:23,554 --> 01:03:24,595
I got here just when
you said "Oh Sam".

425
01:03:24,729 --> 01:03:26,827
You should been here, between
the yield and "the Sam".

426
01:03:28,339 --> 01:03:29,835
You just sit there and
mind your own business.

427
01:03:29,985 --> 01:03:31,836
And don't be calling out my name,
unless you really need me.

428
01:03:43,945 --> 01:03:46,246
- Oh Sammm...
- What's it?

429
01:03:48,606 --> 01:03:50,606
Are you trying to tell me, that candle moved.

430
01:03:51,206 --> 01:03:53,196
You're an idiot my friend.
You know...

431
01:03:53,530 --> 01:03:55,682
If you had known yesterday,
what you know today.

432
01:03:55,733 --> 01:03:57,149
You had been an idiot then to.

433
01:03:57,650 --> 01:04:00,152
Are you listen?
Are you, are you listen, hey...

434
01:04:00,439 --> 01:04:04,506
Listen, get out of here, get out
of here, go sit right here.

435
01:04:04,556 --> 01:04:05,664
Right here, right here,
sit down.

436
01:04:05,706 --> 01:04:08,708
- Right here?
- Right there, sit down.

437
01:04:09,307 --> 01:04:11,106
And listen, I don't want
to call my name anymore.

438
01:04:11,131 --> 01:04:12,668
You sit here and mine
your own...

439
01:04:16,820 --> 01:04:18,348
Always picking on me?

440
01:04:18,570 --> 01:04:21,817
When there's a vacation,
go to Scotland.

441
01:04:22,929 --> 01:04:25,128
Meets, some Duke Rose or some kind of basis

442
01:04:27,010 --> 01:04:30,125
something like that.
No, he's got to a haunted castle.

443
01:05:22,107 --> 01:05:24,753
This is another fine mess I've got myself into.

444
01:05:26,003 --> 01:05:29,306
- Water... water.

445
01:05:29,331 --> 01:05:31,073
Nurse you heard the man,
he wants some water.

446
01:05:31,098 --> 01:05:32,348
Roscoe: Water
Nurse: Sorry Dr.

447
01:05:33,074 --> 01:05:36,076
Here you go.
shut up, you're boring.

448
01:05:36,174 --> 01:05:37,585
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

449
01:05:37,634 --> 01:05:38,934
Interesting specimen we got here.

450
01:05:39,234 --> 01:05:41,584
Where did you get that kilt?
The Axel Rose wardrobe department.

451
01:05:41,734 --> 01:05:43,186
Give me a little reggae.

452
01:05:43,211 --> 01:05:46,583
Dr., will he work for
your experiment?

453
01:05:46,734 --> 01:05:49,444
A strong possibilities I think he will.

454
01:05:49,844 --> 01:05:50,912
In fact...

455
01:05:50,937 --> 01:05:52,201
last time I saw a head
like that like that,

456
01:05:52,226 --> 01:05:53,942
it was floating in
a bottle from formaldehyde

457
01:05:54,843 --> 01:05:56,358
Nurse: One second.
Dr: Behave.

458
01:05:56,676 --> 01:05:59,856
Here, here take it.

459
01:06:00,806 --> 01:06:03,657
No, no, no...
his temperature is dropping

460
01:06:03,809 --> 01:06:04,506
down his throat.

461
01:06:06,268 --> 01:06:07,864
That ain't gonna work.
Let me see here.

462
01:06:09,968 --> 01:06:12,866
Oh, well a think his pulse.

463
01:06:12,891 --> 01:06:14,866
Hum, maybe is dead and
my watch stopped.

464
01:06:15,517 --> 01:06:17,077
This thing isn't working.
What we got in here?

465
01:06:19,777 --> 01:06:21,344
Stop looking at me
when I look at you.

466
01:06:21,369 --> 01:06:23,668
You making me nervous.
This isn't a peep show

467
01:06:25,378 --> 01:06:26,500
No, no, I can't tell.

468
01:06:27,537 --> 01:06:28,520
What is this, uh...

469
01:06:28,545 --> 01:06:30,329
What is this fungus
you've over here.

470
01:06:30,486 --> 01:06:34,337
- That some fungus, doc.
- Well I'm not a great deal, no, no.

471
01:06:34,434 --> 01:06:38,896
Dr I think you're making a
mistake, that's, that's, his head.

472
01:06:39,097 --> 01:06:40,945
And this his head then
he's making a mistake.

473
01:06:42,394 --> 01:06:43,444
Well all on all.

474
01:06:44,144 --> 01:06:46,660
A nice piece of blubber.
Does your face hurt?

475
01:06:47,204 --> 01:06:49,004
- No
- it's killing me.

476
01:06:49,304 --> 01:06:51,704
This condition you've, is it painful?

477
01:06:53,254 --> 01:06:55,222
Well, Sam hit me on
the nose last week.

478
01:06:55,258 --> 01:06:57,257
I think he broken
a bone in my nose.

479
01:06:57,416 --> 01:06:58,414
What is he saying?

480
01:06:58,439 --> 01:07:00,505
He said he has a bone in his nose.

481
01:07:00,531 --> 01:07:03,130
Well he must be member of the *** tribe, so give me a hammer

482
01:07:03,167 --> 01:07:04,415
and I'll banging the
bone out of his nose.

483
01:07:07,326 --> 01:07:08,727
It's... hammer time.

484
01:07:08,976 --> 01:07:09,724
Stop.

485
01:07:09,975 --> 01:07:11,427
- Why?
- You can't touch this.

486
01:07:11,524 --> 01:07:13,775
- What?
- Get some water on my knee.

487
01:07:13,976 --> 01:07:15,224
Hum, hold the hammer.

488
01:07:15,526 --> 01:07:16,275
It's fucking.

489
01:07:16,337 --> 01:07:19,186
Oh well, I've just...
Bring out your leg, ok.

490
01:07:20,437 --> 01:07:22,170
This won't hurt, too much.

491
01:07:32,115 --> 01:07:34,565
- Thank you.
- Oh, you're welcome.

492
01:07:35,015 --> 01:07:37,468
Glad to make you feel better.
Nurse, come here, now.

493
01:07:38,165 --> 01:07:40,267
You see with he, the
line over here.

494
01:07:40,417 --> 01:07:42,126
All right, of the
dopamine fluid here

495
01:07:42,151 --> 01:07:43,827
on the hypothalamus
adrenal cortex

496
01:07:43,852 --> 01:07:44,977
goes up here

497
01:07:45,125 --> 01:07:46,725
and the basal ganglia of the brain

498
01:07:46,775 --> 01:07:49,275
this allows him along with this cortex *** over here

499
01:07:49,425 --> 01:07:50,735
for 1% mentality.

500
01:07:51,635 --> 01:07:54,635
- Is that bad?
- Well scientifically speaking.

501
01:07:54,686 --> 01:07:55,685
He's the perfect moron.

502
01:07:56,135 --> 01:07:56,985
That's wonderful.

503
01:07:57,887 --> 01:07:59,988
Son you're gonna help us
to make medical history.

504
01:08:00,885 --> 01:08:01,885
Me...

505
01:08:02,298 --> 01:08:04,165
Ain't got the brains for it.

506
01:08:06,095 --> 01:08:08,944
- Oh yes you do.
- You see your brain

507
01:08:08,994 --> 01:08:10,748
is the perfect need for our experiment.

508
01:08:10,905 --> 01:08:13,325
You've the perfect dimensions,
the perfect mentality

509
01:08:13,405 --> 01:08:15,906
and most important you're perfectly compatible

510
01:08:16,005 --> 01:08:17,454
with our ape right over there

511
01:08:19,555 --> 01:08:23,916
- Him, that big chimney sweeps.
- How many apes do you see here?

512
01:08:25,716 --> 01:08:28,853
You ain't gonna do it, you ain't gonna make a monkey out of me.

513
01:08:29,805 --> 01:08:32,138
Switch up of brains.
You're crazy.

514
01:08:32,902 --> 01:08:34,052
Besides, I hate bananas.

515
01:08:34,903 --> 01:08:38,013
Unfortunately young man
you don't any choice in this matter.

516
01:08:40,514 --> 01:08:41,953
Ah quick invigorating.

517
01:08:43,203 --> 01:08:45,251
You have a fine body-butt, you do.

518
01:08:46,703 --> 01:08:50,755
My lord I think it will time for me to leave, ok.

519
01:08:51,003 --> 01:08:52,136
A grand idea lad.

520
01:08:53,011 --> 01:08:55,964
I think I'll have a wee sniff
of scotch and do the same.

521
01:08:56,413 --> 01:08:57,962
Will you be joining me my Lady.

522
01:08:58,962 --> 01:09:00,463
No I don't think so my dearest.

523
01:09:01,213 --> 01:09:04,274
I think I'll do a bit of reading first.
Girl things you know.

524
01:09:05,124 --> 01:09:06,771
Witch is spells look.

525
01:09:07,573 --> 01:09:09,973
Will you be careful my Lass.
There's a full moon over the

526
01:09:09,998 --> 01:09:11,273
moors tonight.

527
01:09:12,135 --> 01:09:15,534
I'll be all manner of gremlins
and pixies causing mischief.

528
01:09:16,585 --> 01:09:18,384
I shall hear your
warning my dearest.

529
01:09:50,088 --> 01:09:51,387
You horny little mutt

530
01:09:52,676 --> 01:09:55,125
Could you, stop it, stop that.

531
01:09:55,392 --> 01:09:59,377
Get a *** something at least,
do it the right way, not on my leg.

532
01:09:59,996 --> 01:10:03,797
Christ, sit down, calm down,
calm down.

533
01:10:06,499 --> 01:10:07,499
Calm down.

534
01:10:55,790 --> 01:10:58,599
It's so cute, the little doggy is carrying home bone.

535
01:11:11,790 --> 01:11:13,899
You like that? Do you feel good?

536
01:14:46,490 --> 01:14:46,910
Now wait,

537
01:14:47,590 --> 01:14:48,400
why don't you...

538
01:14:49,490 --> 01:14:52,000
...do me like a doggy? ok?

539
01:17:57,152 --> 01:18:00,754
Oh, hi, remember me, I use to be
the star, in this picture.

540
01:18:01,512 --> 01:18:03,709
Now, I got no sex, no fun

541
01:18:04,157 --> 01:18:06,481
And soon, to have,
no agent mother fucker.

542
01:18:13,955 --> 01:18:16,559
Oh Lorna, telling me the things,
I've been waiting to hear

543
01:18:16,659 --> 01:18:19,408
said them soon, said them loud
and say them proud

544
01:18:19,611 --> 01:18:20,959
for, I can't wait no more.

545
01:18:24,519 --> 01:18:27,221
- Excuse me.
- Lorna, what're you doing.

546
01:18:37,295 --> 01:18:40,545
Did someone get the license plate,
of the truck that hit me.

547
01:18:43,755 --> 01:18:44,755
What the hell is in here?

548
01:18:48,757 --> 01:18:49,557
Tools !!!

549
01:18:50,756 --> 01:18:53,309
Eureka, success, a way out.

550
01:18:54,267 --> 01:18:55,066
In here.

551
01:19:06,974 --> 01:19:09,528
Lorna, good you're here, yeah.

552
01:19:10,131 --> 01:19:13,132
Put on a smock, prepare yourself
for medical history.

553
01:19:14,980 --> 01:19:15,980
Hi, tits.

554
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:18,381
Oh, you again.

555
01:19:18,991 --> 01:19:21,347
Yes, this lad over here,
is gonna help us with our experiment.

556
01:19:21,841 --> 01:19:24,640
So, let's get started.

557
01:19:26,091 --> 01:19:28,864
Hey, wait a minute, aren't suppose
to give me some ether or something?

558
01:19:29,366 --> 01:19:31,370
Ether, want to be
put to sleep?

559
01:19:32,817 --> 01:19:34,135
I don't think so.

560
01:19:34,469 --> 01:19:35,919
You aren't getting,
any of that, believe me.

561
01:19:35,970 --> 01:19:39,020
Oh, don't drink that, don't lap, don't ingest
it's poison, what are you nuts?

562
01:19:39,327 --> 01:19:40,928
Besides, it's $14.000, a bottle.

563
01:19:43,426 --> 01:19:45,667
You'll pay for that.
Now, to prepare Congo.

564
01:19:45,767 --> 01:19:50,065
Congo, this one is gonna hurt,
a little bit ok, steady, steady...

565
01:19:50,090 --> 01:19:52,466
God damn it, where's Albert Frankenstein?

566
01:19:52,618 --> 01:19:55,915
His purpose, is to assist me,
in my experiment, where's at?

567
01:19:56,746 --> 01:20:00,201
Well, you might find him out,
in the garden, howling at the moon.

568
01:20:01,297 --> 01:20:02,119
That's great.

569
01:20:02,319 --> 01:20:04,516
While, he's out howling at the moon,
I'm gonna go, find him.

570
01:20:04,616 --> 01:20:06,969
And you two, just keep an eye,
on the imbecile over there, ok.

571
01:20:08,018 --> 01:20:10,468
Loving one of your own, by the way,
I'll *** with that.

572
01:20:12,278 --> 01:20:15,278
I'm getting really tired,
of his insane experiments.

573
01:20:15,779 --> 01:20:18,129
I wish, (Dr.) Heimlich would,
experiments on me, a little.

574
01:20:19,827 --> 01:20:22,486
That's a good plan sister,
then you turn me a loose.

575
01:20:23,236 --> 01:20:23,941
Shut up.

576
01:20:25,338 --> 01:20:27,991
Oh, why would you want him,
to experiment on you?

577
01:20:28,541 --> 01:20:30,491
Well, I don't mean,
in that way, I mean

578
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:32,040
Well, you know.

579
01:20:33,516 --> 01:20:34,516
I know.

580
01:20:35,263 --> 01:20:36,263
The girls:
Shut up.

581
01:21:31,763 --> 01:21:34,000
Let me examine what you have out of there

582
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
***

583
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
Get on your hands and knees

584
01:29:08,764 --> 01:29:10,063
Oh, my god.

585
01:29:10,461 --> 01:29:13,312
I leave you two along,
for 27 minutes

586
01:29:13,337 --> 01:29:15,585
two positions, two
fake orgasms later

587
01:29:15,661 --> 01:29:18,675
and this is how I find you,
now pull yourselves together.

588
01:29:18,875 --> 01:29:22,274
Euh, pu, whatever,
something like that.

589
01:29:23,073 --> 01:29:24,169
I'm sorry Dr.

590
01:29:27,011 --> 01:29:29,365
Dr.:
Albert, *** that savage beast.

591
01:29:43,563 --> 01:29:45,163
I can guarantee
in the next sequel

592
01:29:45,514 --> 01:29:46,837
and my contract I'm
going to have

593
01:29:46,913 --> 01:29:48,579
a chainsaw for these type of things.

594
01:29:55,995 --> 01:29:57,243
Ok, sponge.

595
01:29:58,944 --> 01:30:02,642
Not that today, sponge...
Great, now my hand is gonna fall a sleep.

596
01:30:02,743 --> 01:30:03,743
Scalpel.

597
01:30:04,094 --> 01:30:06,654
Dr. It seems that, all of our tools
are missing.

598
01:30:07,454 --> 01:30:09,753
Oh, well my main tools is right here,
thank you very much.

599
01:30:10,004 --> 01:30:12,654
Look, I'm sick and tired
of having, to be surround

600
01:30:12,704 --> 01:30:14,103
by a competent fools,
like yourselves.

601
01:30:14,563 --> 01:30:16,313
I've never been so insulted.

602
01:30:17,565 --> 01:30:19,414
- It's still early yet.
- Shut up.

603
01:30:20,313 --> 01:30:21,963
He said it and not me.

604
01:30:22,063 --> 01:30:24,356
Enough of this foolishness,
look I'm not gonna get

605
01:30:24,381 --> 01:30:27,686
my brain transplant,
ever done at this pace.

606
01:30:28,373 --> 01:30:31,224
Well Lorna, I like you, to
assist me, in finding my tools.

607
01:30:31,723 --> 01:30:32,625
Why me?

608
01:30:32,925 --> 01:30:35,181
Why, because I don't want to
leave and then come back

609
01:30:35,206 --> 01:30:36,182
and find another,
shameless display

610
01:30:36,207 --> 01:30:38,523
of a sex scene, upon my return.

611
01:30:39,582 --> 01:30:40,230
Come on.

612
01:30:41,184 --> 01:30:43,284
I'll take the high road,
and you take the low road.

613
01:30:43,536 --> 01:30:46,795
Oh no, not that,
stupid joke again.

614
01:30:46,893 --> 01:30:47,693
They get worse.

615
01:30:51,445 --> 01:30:52,041
Albert.

616
01:30:53,341 --> 01:30:54,793
Don't you get, you can do
something, about this.

617
01:31:06,214 --> 01:31:07,214
It's much better.

618
01:31:07,816 --> 01:31:08,563
You know.

619
01:31:09,564 --> 01:31:11,064
There's something about you.

620
01:31:12,515 --> 01:31:14,565
Animal magnetism, I don't know.

621
01:31:16,175 --> 01:31:17,175
You think so?

622
01:31:17,573 --> 01:31:18,573
I do.

623
01:31:18,924 --> 01:31:19,924
Oh, Albert.

624
01:31:20,572 --> 01:31:21,572
Oh, ***.

625
01:31:22,125 --> 01:31:23,647
Not again.

626
01:35:39,351 --> 01:35:40,351
Oh, this is good.

627
01:35:41,204 --> 01:35:43,252
So tell them maybe
something in our minds.

628
