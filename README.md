# Subtitles and captions for Adult Videos

## About credits

It appears my subtitles are uploaded on some websites by different people. That's great. Unfortunately, I notice that my credits are removed.

I don't mean to make money, nor to be famous, but the credits are the only way to inform users how to contact me. Having the subtitles completed or fixed are my only reward, so please share them a lot but keep my e-mail address in them.

Thanks !

## Subtitles for porn? Is it a joke?

No.

Actually, a lot of movies have a very good plot. Especially those comedy or romance oriented.

I write these subtitles/captions for hearing impaired or for people who which to translate the dialogs into another language.

## If you wanna help

You'll see some ___"***"___ or ___"(?)"___ in the dialogs. It means there is one of several words I was unable to cacth. If you can complete them, let me know! :)

## Quality of the captions

Transcripting and syncing dialogs is a hard work. I don't pretend to make perfect captions, especially because of having some hearing troubles and not being an english native speaker.

The first subtitles I made have very bad sync, I try to improve this part for the new ones.
Also, some subtitles are actually a transcription of Ducth or Sweden that I wrote back and translated in English. So the transcription may be quite different than the real dialogs.

## Tools

Depending on the country or editor, a same movie may have different introductions. As a consequence, subtitles may be delayed for some seconds. Many sites provides tools to fix the delay, here is one: http://subtitlefix.com/index.php

These subtitles used to be published on opensubtitles.org. Now, you can also find them on subscene.com
