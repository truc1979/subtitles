1
00:02:02,229 --> 00:02:03,439
Don't worry.

2
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,149
Dr Harper is more-than-capable.

3
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,420
I'm just so scared for George.

4
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,930
Was this really necessary?

5
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:13,340
Absolutely.

6
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,840
Without a complete identity change,

7
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,330
your husband's life was in grave danger.

8
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,090
We received intel that after the capture of Hussein,

9
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,220
and angered four terrorist factions,

10
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,380
they put a price on his head.

11
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:30,950
I understand.

12
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:35,300
Yeah. It looks like he's almost done.

13
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,240
Do you want to go in and take a peek?

14
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,639
Yes.

15
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,220
Sir?

16
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,070
How much was it?

17
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,360
What?

18
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:46,039
The price on George's head?

19
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,100
Ah. Four dollars.

20
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,000
Four dollars?

21
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,490
Four dollars?

22
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Oh!

23
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,180
Excellent work, Doctor.

24
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,070
That's quite a transformation.

25
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:04,910
Yeah... this is incredible.

26
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,400
Who is this anyway?

27
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,510
Some famous porn star: Evan Stone.

28
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:18,700
Agent Z was quite insistent on his new face.

29
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,350
He also thought you'd appreciate... this.

30
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,180
Oh!

31
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:26,317
Holy shit.

32
00:03:26,317 --> 00:03:28,300
What is that?

33
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,270
A penis implant.

34
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,210
We had this special order,

35
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:35,040
the extra huge size he requested.

36
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,161
Look at the size of those testicles.

37
00:03:43,161 --> 00:03:44,351
Oh yeah...

38
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,490
Yes...!

39
00:03:45,961 --> 00:03:48,802
A curious side-effect I'm afraid.

40
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,239
After performing a
facelift at this magnitude,

41
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,049
we had so much extra skin...

42
00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:58,198
Frankly we didn't know
where else to put it so...

43
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,719
Hmmm.

44
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,090
Oh no waste, he's finally got some balls.

45
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,940
And he will be fully
functional in about 3 days.

46
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,230
Yes!

47
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,320
Yeah, while you're at it, Doc,

48
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,771
can you laser off those stupid tattoos?

49
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:25,020
Sure. Easy enough.

50
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:30,830
Woo.

51
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,080
Three days. Three days.

52
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,571
*Across the pond, British
agents Jacks and Watson*

53
00:04:48,571 --> 00:04:51,471
*have safely returned to
England where they continue*

54
00:04:51,471 --> 00:04:54,411
*to celebrate the success
of their mission*

55
00:04:54,411 --> 00:04:55,911
*the way dashing British
agents often do...*

56
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,730
Just as we thought we were done for it,

57
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,570
was to be the end of us,

58
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:11,250
there was a loud crashing sound...

59
00:05:12,539 --> 00:05:14,889
BANG! Missile come bursting
through the palace room,

60
00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:16,439
just missing us by inches.

61
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,600
Do you have any idea how difficult is to

62
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,000
operate a successful mission while

63
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,220
dressing with this garments?

64
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:28,660
What we was wearing is
inconsequential Watson.

65
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,180
I'd have to disagree, sir.

66
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,480
It's quite difficult to outrun
the hostiles in a skirt.

67
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,780
Enough Watson.

68
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:39,760
So there we were:

69
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,460
Battling our way through
the palace guards,

70
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,570
heavily outnumbered.

71
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,920
The bear in mind. We never
expected to make it out alive,

72
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,210
but still we battled on.

73
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,420
We fought away for the flames
and the falling debris.

74
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:55,250
Until we caught up with
the evil: terrorist Hussein.

75
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,600
To save the world from impending doom.

76
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,950
- And rescue the harem girls!
- Quite.

77
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:06,089
Now her Majesty the Queen
has decided to, Mr. Jacks and I,

78
00:06:06,089 --> 00:06:08,900
with the... utmost honor.

79
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,230
Yes, we ought to be
knighted tomorrow morning.

80
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:11,700
(Oooh...)

81
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:15,790
Can you believe that, man?

82
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,610
Sir Jacks. Sir Watson.

83
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,220
Yes.

84
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,830
Now, if you wouldn't...
excuse us ladies.

85
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,869
We need to get our rest
for tomorrow ceremonies.

86
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,160
- Slipper sir?
- Thank you, Watson.

87
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,300
Are you sure we can't
stay just a bit longer?

88
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:36,271
Perhaps we can help you
relax before the big event.

89
00:06:37,009 --> 00:06:39,819
Yes, I've never made it
with a knight before.

90
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:42,700
Well technically we're
not quite knight yet.

91
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,889
Shut up! Watson!

92
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,940
We certainly did rise
to the occasion.

93
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,490
George?

94
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,530
It's after 7:00 you better be up.

95
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,300
George?

96
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,290
If you make me late on my first
day as an agent,

97
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:39,720
I'll kill you myself.

98
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,150
[Whisper:] George?

99
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,420
George?

100
00:18:11,721 --> 00:18:13,881
[A bit louder:] George?

101
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,430
- [Loud:] George!
- Ah!

102
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,380
[*gunshot*]

103
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,980
What the fuck is wrong
with you?

104
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,670
George, you almost killed me!

105
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,160
Thought you were hostile.

106
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,530
Hostile? I'll show you "hostile" if
you don't get up.

107
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,800
Idiot!

108
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,930
What much (?)

109
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:45,140
Yeah, back in the day I was...
was quite the athlete.

110
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:48,429
It's pole vaulting around the room,
and... uh...

111
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:52,280
After the sex, well that's when she
actually knighted me.

112
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:57,020
It was quite ***

113
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,530
Agent Z?

114
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,561
I got a mission for you.

115
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,200
Go down and get me a cup of coffee.

116
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,210
[*Laughs*]

117
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:33,180
That just never gets old.

118
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:37,270
Take these authorization
forms down to the labs,

119
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:40,080
we can finalize testing on formula 69.

120
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,150
I will take that.

121
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:56,650
Ever mean to have a little "chat"
with Amy down in the lab.

122
00:20:56,819 --> 00:20:57,819
It's me to do it.

123
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,800
No. You remember what happened last time
we ventured down to

124
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,650
her little den of iniquity?

125
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,460
Stop thinking about it.

126
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,630
*** you pig.

127
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,009
It's gonna be a catfight.

128
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,870
Where are you, Amy?

129
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,920
You, little slut.

130
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,010
Where are you?

131
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,410
That's right.

132
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:21,190
You better hide.

133
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:25,140
You know who was gonna come down here
and kick some ass.

134
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,160
[*eeeew*]

135
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,341
That's interesting.

136
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,330
Hi!

137
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:41,340
Oh. You're not Amy.

138
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,911
No, uh, Amy's out in the field.

139
00:22:43,911 --> 00:22:46,481
She's collecting samples. She
won't be back until next week.

140
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:48,030
I'm her sister Martha.

141
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,809
Where are your pants?

142
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:54,310
Oh...

143
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,700
I'm working at a top-secret project
called "Formula 69".

144
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,960
Formula 69? All right...

145
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,750
You people are into some
seriously kinky shit down here.

146
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:06,920
Mm-hmm.

147
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:10,030
Well you see we've managed
to isolate a pheromone,

148
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:11,910
that's only detectable to females.

149
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:16,340
And also odorless and colorless.

150
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:19,140
It induces extreme sexual arousal,

151
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,670
and pleasurable endorphins when inhaled.

152
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:24,460
Thus clouding the judgment
of any female.

153
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,220
And when mixed with any
standard men's cologne,

154
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:30,759
it becomes an invaluable tool
to our male agents,

155
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:34,759
to stracke and obtain information
from would be females acids.

156
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,620
Hmmm... hmm.

157
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,400
God how you freaks the same.

158
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,601
Mumbo jumbo.

159
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:43,170
Well...

160
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:47,811
Thank you for the... chemistry lesson there,
Dr No-Pants.

161
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,011
But I think I'll be going back upstairs,

162
00:23:51,011 --> 00:23:53,361
where the sane people work.

163
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,500
[*spray*]

164
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,600
Now you don't really think that
that's gonna...

165
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:02,800
[*Martha laughs nervously*]

166
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,640
I... I... I didn't mean to actually...

167
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:09,550
Cause I'm not really into... aah...

168
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,130
So tell me...

169
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,781
Do you think your wife is
actually murdering Amy,

170
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,000
or just beating her beyond recognition?

171
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:40,960
Just a thought.

172
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:09,860
[*women moanings*]

173
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,030
Come on, come on... ah!

174
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:58,131
Hmm... yeah.

175
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,120
"You're my favourite fucking lab whore",
tell me!

176
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:08,671
You're my favourite fucking lab whore.

177
00:36:15,669 --> 00:36:17,769
Test formula complete.

178
00:36:17,769 --> 00:36:21,239
Subject reacted with optimal results.

179
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:51,941
(Hmmm)

180
00:36:51,941 --> 00:36:53,561
Wow, I see she got to you too.

181
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,630
Buckingham Palace - England

182
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,300
I can't believe it, sir.

183
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:18,730
I've got to pee again.

184
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:21,630
 this

185
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,630
I told you not to drink so much
tea this morning.

186
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:33,380
[*They're smelling something*]

187
00:37:34,229 --> 00:37:35,939
What's that god-awful stench?

188
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,040
God, sir...

189
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,620
I've stepped in dog poop.

190
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:45,870
Oh my...

191
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:47,970
[*steps*]

192
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:49,060
Quick.

193
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,250
Hmm-hmm.

194
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:56,400
What should I do?

195
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:57,689
Lose the shoes, man.

196
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,090
- No!
- Yes, quick, lose the shoes.

197
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:01,180
Hurry up!

198
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,711
In remembrance of *** given and received,

199
00:38:12,711 --> 00:38:17,211
and for outstanding service to
crown and the country,

200
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:19,521
and on behalf of the Commowealth,

201
00:38:19,521 --> 00:38:21,561
I hereby dub thee

202
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,880
Sir Marcus Jacks.

203
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:27,090
You may rise.

204
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,100
[*oooh*]

205
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,060
Agent Z, agent D,

206
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:57,950
there's an important satellite transmission
for you in the control room.

207
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,690
It's the President.

208
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:23,700
(Hello?)

209
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:25,210
Go ahead, Mr President.

210
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:26,270
This is on?

211
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,720
I don't get good reception in my office.

212
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,190
Ah, agents Z and D.

213
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,120
I'd like to congratulate you on the
successful mission,

214
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:40,021
and in capturing that really
really bad guy...

215
00:39:38,359 --> 00:39:44,750
 who's that dudes

216
00:39:40,021 --> 00:39:42,581
... Who's that dude's named, Dick?

217
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:46,571
...and in capturing that really
really bad guy Hussein.

218
00:39:47,531 --> 00:39:50,251
I also want to thank you on
behalf of the American public,

219
00:39:50,251 --> 00:39:53,701
because they would have been very
sad to have been blown up.

220
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,470
It was our pleasure, sir.

221
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,850
As a personal gesture,

222
00:39:58,850 --> 00:40:02,850
I would like to grant you to
the use of my really big boat.

223
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:04,850
And it's a fancy one too,

224
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:07,240
to celebrate your anniversary.

225
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,440
Oh my God!

226
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,540
Thank you Mr President. Sir.

227
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,600
Look at that, Dick,

228
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,040
now that's what I call a missile.

229
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,770
[*flsuhing the toilets*]

230
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:21,640
[*fart*]

231
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,010
Oh my God, do you believe it?

232
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,690
I'm going on a cruise...

233
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:30,750
... on the president's boat!

234
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:32,490
Oh my God.

235
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,380
This is so ***

236
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,260
I never get to go anywhere...

237
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,450
[*indistinct chat*]

238
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,720
- What?
- Who are they?

239
00:40:57,650 --> 00:40:58,860
Well, since you're an agent now,

240
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:00,600
X is auditioning new assistants.

241
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:04,840
He's replacing me?

242
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,850
Uh, pff..

243
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:11,270
This is a top secret mission,

244
00:41:11,450 --> 00:41:13,720
of the utmost importance.

245
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,780
I need for you to take this phone,

246
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:20,200
and answer it whenever I call.

247
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:24,040
If you don't I could be killed.

248
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,730
Do you understand?

249
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,610
He's replacing me.

250
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:52,500
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

251
00:41:59,089 --> 00:42:10,670
okay okay do you understand I understand

252
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:00,660
Okay, okay, okay.

253
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:03,740
Do you understand?

254
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,751
- Understand what?
- [*she laughs*]

255
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:09,270
What was the question again?

256
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,050
(Okay)

257
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:13,600
You're perfect.

258
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:15,530
You're hired.

259
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,700
- Me?
- Me? No, me!

260
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:18,740
No, me!

261
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:20,300
He's talking about me, okay?

262
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:20,950
- Me!
- Me!

263
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:21,660
Hep Hep!

264
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:23,030
Okay, both of you.

265
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:24,530
You're both hired.

266
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:32,561
Stop it.

267
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:33,640
Stop it!

268
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:44,870
[*indistinct chat*]

269
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:54,350
So...

270
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:57,940
You guys are Agent X new
administrative assistants, huh?

271
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:00,850
No, silly, we're secretaries!

272
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:06,610
Unbelievable.

273
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,981
***?
It could have happened to anyone.

274
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,150
But it didn't happen to anyone.

275
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:30,570
It happened to me.

276
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:33,740
I must have keep *** like that.

277
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:45,860
Sir Jacks.

278
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:48,910
Sir Jacks, at your service.

279
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:53,520
Look on the bright side,

280
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:56,370
it's not every day you get into
the Queen's knickers, no? Is it?

281
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,010
Actually she wasn't wearing any, was she?

282
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,080
Come on Tea Biscuit,

283
00:44:03,730 --> 00:44:05,560
let's go slay some dragons.

284
00:44:15,610 --> 00:44:18,930
[*Mission Impossible theme*]

285
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:21,760
(Agent Jacks, agent Watson,)

286
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,730
(do you read? This is agent Q, please respond.)

287
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:39,700
this is Walton we have just intercepted

288
00:44:34,711 --> 00:44:35,761
This is Watson.

289
00:44:35,791 --> 00:44:38,781
(We ave just received a coded transmission)

290
00:44:38,781 --> 00:44:40,781
(Seems that North Korean leader Jong-Il has ***)

291
00:44:40,781 --> 00:44:43,511
(large quantites of unknown substance,)

292
00:44:43,511 --> 00:44:44,681
(for use in a weapon.)

293
00:44:45,372 --> 00:44:46,782
***

294
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,250
(We are not sure.)

295
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:50,900
(But the message allude to an
impending large-scale attack.)

296
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:53,350
(We attract a vessel transport
one of the ships)

297
00:44:53,350 --> 00:44:54,500
(***)

298
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:57,070
(Proceed immediately to *** air force base.)

299
00:44:57,410 --> 00:44:59,090
(your *** is already in route and)

300
00:44:59,090 --> 00:45:00,860
(intelligence waiting to further review)

301
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:02,290
(with ***)

302
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:06,440
(This message will self-destruct in... 5...)

303
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:09,700
(4... 3... 2...)

304
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:11,520
(1...) [*BANG*]

305
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:26,010
I hate when they do that.

306
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:29,110
That's the fourth one this week.

307
00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:31,260
And I wanted some toast tonight.

308
00:45:38,350 --> 00:45:39,900
Now, the mirror on the wall,

309
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:42,020
who's the sexiest of them all?

310
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:01,880
[*beep*]

311
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:04,940
Many pardons, Supreme Commander Sir,

312
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:06,940
the *** is here to see you.

313
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:11,330
Oh... have a wait in my office.

314
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:19,010
I'm so sexy.

315
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:21,890
She not resist me this time.

316
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:28,960
Ah...

317
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:32,600
Jung-Ho... What a pleasure.

318
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:39,520
Sorry for the interruption, Commander,

319
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:42,670
I was sent to informing that
Dr Kwan has arrived safely,

320
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:44,760
and is now working on your formula.

321
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,900
He's guaranteed me he'll
have results shortly.

322
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:49,280
Excellent.

323
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:53,100
Wacky americans keep searching
for nuclear weapons.

324
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,300
They will never suspect this.

325
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:58,100
I so smart!
I genius!

326
00:46:58,470 --> 00:46:59,390
Genius!

327
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:04,100
Tell Dr Kwan he has exactly 24 hours.

328
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,900
General So-Hung will be joining you to
oversee completion of the attack.

329
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:12,320
Oh, Yung-Ho?

330
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:14,810
Shall we make with the sex?

331
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:19,600
Yung-Ho?

332
00:47:19,850 --> 00:47:22,170
Oh... You play hard-to-get?
Alrighty!

333
00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:23,470
I've been stretching.

334
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:24,570
[*ouch*]

335
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:26,180
Yung-Ho?

336
00:47:26,911 --> 00:47:27,901
Yung-Ho?

337
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:47,210
From now on...

338
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,600
...you're gonna be known as agents...

339
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:52,890
... "T"...

340
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:56,530
... and "A".

341
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
You know it is a terrible thing, though,

342
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:07,410
to think that you may not come
back from one of these missions.

343
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:09,250
[*ooooh*]

344
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:13,300
I'm sorry...

345
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:15,960
I'm okay though.

346
00:48:17,350 --> 00:48:20,120
'Cause it's just something
that I, CIA agents,

347
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:21,811
have to put up with, you know.

348
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:24,810
Wear it like a badge of honor

349
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,640
Still the... thought of never...

350
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:32,350
...have a look or touch you again...

351
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:36,850
I'm alright...

352
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:41,700
(No no, we can like that, eternally...)

353
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:42,730
No...

354
00:48:46,650 --> 00:48:50,371
(No... we can...)

355
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:08,870
Ouch, hold it!

356
00:49:10,830 --> 00:49:12,090
Okay, okay...

357
00:49:15,050 --> 00:49:17,360
Ladies, there is enough of agent X...

358
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:19,180
...to pull around.

359
00:49:19,810 --> 00:49:21,150
(yeah...)

360
00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:23,230
...and... listen...

361
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:24,750
if you're gonna be a team...

362
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:27,800
We're gonna see how you...

363
00:49:28,610 --> 00:49:30,610
You know... work to...

364
00:49:31,610 --> 00:49:32,850
together.

365
00:59:34,890 --> 00:59:37,890
[*Jaws theme*]

366
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:01,260
[*Laughs*]

367
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:18,850
[*Laughs*]

368
01:00:28,230 --> 01:00:29,100
Ah!

369

01:37:40,940 --> 01:37:46,070
okay but Sir are talking rubbing it in

518
01:37:42,950 --> 01:37:49,210
my face that was so sensitive man let's

519
01:37:46,070 --> 01:37:49,210
just brief Rachel now would you

520
01:37:51,890 --> 01:37:55,770
well as you know this island is the

521
01:37:54,270 --> 01:37:57,260
smallest of the group belonging to North

522
01:37:55,770 --> 01:37:59,730
Korean leader Jong Il

523
01:37:57,260 --> 01:38:01,410
now a British intel has informed us that

524
01:37:59,730 --> 01:38:05,130
he has hidden some sort of weapon here

525
01:38:01,410 --> 01:38:08,520
in preparing for attack we've been using

526
01:38:05,130 --> 01:38:10,760
select imagery to scan the terrain for

527
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:16,950
any photographic element of anything

528
01:38:10,760 --> 01:38:19,670
man-made existing out here so we began

529
01:38:16,950 --> 01:38:22,740
searching the island on for two days ago

530
01:38:19,670 --> 01:38:26,430
thinking perhaps jong-il had stashed the

531
01:38:22,740 --> 01:38:30,450
weapons in a cave that's so far we've

532
01:38:26,430 --> 01:38:31,680
had no luck hmm have you guys consider

533
01:38:30,450 --> 01:38:47,160
the possibility that maybe it's

534
01:38:31,680 --> 01:38:49,470
underground no yes okay here I'll hack

535
01:38:47,160 --> 01:38:52,080
into one of the USS heat-seeking

536
01:38:49,470 --> 01:38:55,730
satellites reposition it to scan this

537
01:38:52,080 --> 01:38:55,730
island see what we can find

538
01:39:05,480 --> 01:39:10,920
