1
00:02:02,229 --> 00:02:10,689
Don't worry.
Dr Harper is more-than-capable.

2
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:14,320
I'm just so scared for George.

3
00:02:10,689 --> 00:02:16,060
Was this really necessary?
Absolutely.

4
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:20,890
Without a complete identity change your

5
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:22,810
husband's life was in grave danger.

6
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:24,850
We received intel that after the capture of Hussein,

7
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:28,030
and angered four terrorist factions,

8
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:35,080
they put a price on his head.

9
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:36,340
I understand.
Yeah. It looks like he's almost done.

10
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,680
Do you want to go in and take a peek?

11
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,639
Yes.

12
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:55,680
Sir? How much was it? What the price on George's head?

13
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:55,680
Ah. Four dollars.
$4? Four dollars?

14
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,510
Oh!

15
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:05,040
Excellent work, Doctor.

16
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:08,560
That's quite a transformation.
Yeah, this is incredible.

17
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:17,360
Who is this anyway?
Some famous porn star: Evan Stone.

18
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:20,989
Agent Z was quite insistent on his new face.

19
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:24,260
He also thought you'd appreciate... this.

20
00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:30,010
Oh

21
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:33,290
Holy shit.What is that?
A penis implant.

22
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:36,879
We had this special order, the extra huge size he requested.

23
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:48,840
Look at the size of those testicles.
Oh yeah.

24
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:52,239
Yes. A curious side-effect I'm afraid.

25
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:56,170
After performing a facelift at this magnitude,

26
00:03:52,239 --> 00:04:00,900
we had so much extra skin.

27
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:05,400
Frankly we didn't know where else to put it so...
Hmmm.

28
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:09,459
Oh no waste, he's finally got some balls.

29
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:11,210
And he will be fully functional in about 3 days.

30
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,750
Yes!

31
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:24,360
Yeah, while you're at it, Doc, can you laser off those stupid tattoos?

32
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:25,530
Sure. Easy enough.

33
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:33,470
Woo.

34
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:38,720
Three days. Three days.

35
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,571
*Across the pond, British agents Jacks and Watson

36
00:04:48,571 --> 00:04:51,471
have safely returned to England where they continue

37
00:04:51,471 --> 00:04:54,411
to celebrate the success of their mission

38
00:04:54,411 --> 00:04:55,911
the way dashing British agents often do...*

39
00:05:03,889 --> 00:05:10,470
Just as we thought we were done for it,

40
00:05:06,509 --> 00:05:13,889
was to be the end of us,

41
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:11,539
there was a loud crashing sound...

42
00:05:11,539 --> 00:05:14,539
BANG, missile come bursting through the palace room,

43
00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:17,150
just missing us by inches.

44
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:23,130
Do you have any idea how difficult is to

45
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:26,069
operate a successful mission while

46
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:24,370
dressing with this garments?

47
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:27,370
What we was wearing is inconsequential Watson.

48
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,080
I'd have to disagree, sir.

49
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:39,449
It's quite difficult to outrun the hostiles in a skirt.

50
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,980
Enough Watson.

51
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,980
So there we were:

52
00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:46,620
Battling our way through the palace guards,

53
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:48,750
heavily outnumbered.

54
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:50,819
The bear in mind. We never expected to make it out alive,

55
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:52,139
but still we battled on.

56
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:52,789
We fought away for the flames and the falling debris.

57
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:56,610
Until we caught up with the evil: terrorist Hussein.

58
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:59,250
To save the world from impending doom.

59
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:59,870
- And rescue the harem girls!
- Quite.

60
00:06:01,179 --> 00:06:04,179
Now her Majesty the Queen has decided to Mr. Jacks and I

61
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,990
with the utmost honor.

62
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:11,480
Yes we ought to be knighted tomorrow morning.

63
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:17,350
Can you believe that, man?

64
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:14,820
IIIIIIIIICIIIIIIII

65
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:20,659
believe that man sir Jack's it sir what

66
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:24,810
yes

67
00:06:20,659 --> 00:06:25,949
now if you wouldn't excuse us ladies we

68
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:29,030
need to get our rest for tomorrow

69
00:06:25,949 --> 00:06:31,710
ceremonies slipper sir Thank You Watson

70
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:35,009
are you sure we can't stay just a bit

71
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:36,469
longer perhaps we can help you relax

72
00:06:35,009 --> 00:06:39,360
before the big event

73
00:06:36,469 --> 00:06:42,539
yes I've never made it with a night

74
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:46,550
before well technically we're not quite

75
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:46,550

Oh

00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:20,310
Oh

83
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:05,230
Oh

84
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,060
Oh

85
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:43,470

125
00:23:01,649 --> 00:23:08,700
you people are into some seriously kinky

126
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:10,379
shit down here mm-hmm well you see we've

127
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:13,980
managed to isolate a pheromone that's

128
00:23:10,379 --> 00:23:17,039
only detectable to females and although

129
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:20,039
odorless and colorless it induces

130
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:22,679
extreme sexual arousal and pleasurable

131
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:25,049
endorphins when inhaled thus clouding

132
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:27,299
the judgment of any female and when

133
00:23:25,049 --> 00:23:29,879
mixed with any standard men's cologne it

134
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:32,429
becomes an invaluable tool to our male

135
00:23:29,879 --> 00:23:37,950
agents to stracke and obtain information

136
00:23:32,429 --> 00:23:44,490

01:37:40,940 --> 01:37:46,070

428
01:37:42,950 --> 01:37:49,210
my face that was so sensitive man let's

429
01:37:46,070 --> 01:37:49,210
just brief Rachel now would you

430
01:37:51,890 --> 01:37:55,770
well as you know this island is the

431
01:37:54,270 --> 01:37:57,260
smallest of the group belonging to North

432
01:37:55,770 --> 01:37:59,730
Korean leader Jong Il

433
01:37:57,260 --> 01:38:01,410
now a British intel has informed us that

434
01:37:59,730 --> 01:38:05,130
he has hidden some sort of weapon here

435
01:38:01,410 --> 01:38:08,520
in preparing for attack we've been using

436
01:38:05,130 --> 01:38:10,760
select imagery to scan the terrain for

437
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:16,950
any photographic element of anything

438
01:38:10,760 --> 01:38:19,670
man-made existing out here so we began

439
01:38:16,950 --> 01:38:22,740
searching the island on for two days ago

440
01:38:19,670 --> 01:38:26,430
thinking perhaps jong-il had stashed the

441
01:38:22,740 --> 01:38:30,450
weapons in a cave that's so far we've

442
01:38:26,430 --> 01:38:31,680
had no luck hmm have you guys consider

443
01:38:30,450 --> 01:38:47,160
the possibility that maybe it's

444
01:38:31,680 --> 01:38:49,470
underground no yes okay here I'll hack

445
01:38:47,160 --> 01:38:52,080
into one of the USS heat-seeking

446
01:38:49,470 --> 01:38:55,730
satellites reposition it to scan this

447
01:38:52,080 --> 01:38:55,730

448
01:39:05,480 --> 01:39:10,920
