1
00:02:02,229 --> 00:02:03,439
Don't worry.

2
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,149
Dr Harper is more-than-capable.

3
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,420
I'm just so scared for George.

4
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,930
Was this really necessary?

5
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:13,340
Absolutely.

6
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,840
Without a complete identity change,

7
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,330
your husband's life was in grave danger.

8
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,090
We received intel that after the capture of Hussein,

9
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,220
and angered four terrorist factions,

10
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,380
they put a price on his head.

11
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:30,950
I understand.

12
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:35,300
Yeah. It looks like he's almost done.

13
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,240
Do you want to go in and take a peek?

14
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,639
Yes.

15
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,220
Sir?

16
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,070
How much was it?

17
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,360
What?

18
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:46,039
The price on George's head?

19
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,100
Ah. Four dollars.

20
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,000
Four dollars?

21
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,490
Four dollars?

22
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Oh!

23
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,180
Excellent work, Doctor.

24
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,070
That's quite a transformation.

25
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:04,910
Yeah... this is incredible.

26
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,400
Who is this anyway?

27
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,510
Some famous porn star: Evan Stone.

28
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:18,700
Agent Z was quite insistent on his new face.

29
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,350
He also thought you'd appreciate... this.

30
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,180
Oh!

31
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:26,317
Holy shit.

32
00:03:26,317 --> 00:03:28,300
What is that?

33
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,270
A penis implant.

34
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,210
We had this special order,

35
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:35,040
the extra huge size he requested.

36
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,161
Look at the size of those testicles.

37
00:03:43,161 --> 00:03:44,351
Oh yeah...

38
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,490
Yes...!

39
00:03:45,961 --> 00:03:48,802
A curious side-effect I'm afraid.

40
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,239
After performing a
facelift at this magnitude,

41
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,049
we had so much extra skin...

42
00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:58,198
Frankly we didn't know
where else to put it so...

43
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,719
Hmmm.

44
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,090
Oh no waste, he's finally got some balls.

45
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,940
And he will be fully
functional in about 3 days.

46
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,230
Yes!

47
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,320
Yeah, while you're at it, Doc,

48
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,771
can you laser off those stupid tattoos?

49
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:25,020
Sure. Easy enough.

50
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:30,830
Woo.

51
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,080
Three days. Three days.

52
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,571
*Across the pond, British
agents Jacks and Watson*

53
00:04:48,571 --> 00:04:51,471
*have safely returned to
England where they continue*

54
00:04:51,471 --> 00:04:54,411
*to celebrate the success
of their mission*

55
00:04:54,411 --> 00:04:55,911
*the way dashing British
agents often do...*

56
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,730
Just as we thought we were done for it,

57
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,570
was to be the end of us,

58
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:11,250
there was a loud crashing sound...

59
00:05:12,539 --> 00:05:14,889
BANG! Missile come bursting
through the palace room,

60
00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:16,439
just missing us by inches.

61
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,600
Do you have any idea how difficult is to

62
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,000
operate a successful mission while

63
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,220
dressing with this garments?

64
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:28,660
What we was wearing is
inconsequential Watson.

65
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,180
I'd have to disagree, sir.

66
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,480
It's quite difficult to outrun
the hostiles in a skirt.

67
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,780
Enough Watson.

68
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:39,760
So there we were:

69
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,460
Battling our way through
the palace guards,

70
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,570
heavily outnumbered.

71
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,920
The bear in mind. We never
expected to make it out alive,

72
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,210
but still we battled on.

73
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,420
We fought away for the flames
and the falling debris.

74
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:55,250
Until we caught up with
the evil: terrorist Hussein.

75
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,600
To save the world from impending doom.

76
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,950
- And rescue the harem girls!
- Quite.

77
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:06,089
Now her Majesty the Queen
has decided to, Mr. Jacks and I,

78
00:06:06,089 --> 00:06:08,900
with the... utmost honor.

79
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,230
Yes, we ought to be
knighted tomorrow morning.

80
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:11,700
(Oooh...)

81
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:15,790
Can you believe that, man?

82
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,610
Sir Jacks. Sir Watson.

83
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,220
Yes.

84
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,830
Now, if you wouldn't...
excuse us ladies.

85
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,869
We need to get our rest
for tomorrow ceremonies.

86
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,160
- Slipper sir?
- Thank you, Watson.

87
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,300
Are you sure we can't
stay just a bit longer?

88
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:36,271
Perhaps we can help you
relax before the big event.

89
00:06:37,009 --> 00:06:39,819
Yes, I've never made it
with a knight before.

90
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:42,700
Well technically we're
not quite knight yet.

91
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,889
Shut up! Watson!

92
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,940
We certainly did rise
to the occasion.

93
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,490
George?

94
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,530
It's after 7:00 you better be up.

95
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,300
George?

96
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,290
If you make me late on my first
day as an agent,

97
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:39,720
I'll kill you myself.

98
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,150
[Whisper:] George?

99
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,420
George?

100
00:18:11,721 --> 00:18:13,881
[A bit louder:] George?

101
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,430
- [Loud:] George!
- Ah!

102
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,380
[*gunshot*]

103
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,980
What the fuck is wrong
with you?

104
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,670
George, you almost killed me!

105
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,160
Thought you were hostile.

106
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,530
Hostile? I'll show you "hostile" if
you don't get up.

107
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,800
Idiot!

108
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,930
What much (?)

109
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:45,140
Yeah, back in the day I was...
was quite the athlete.

110
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:48,429
It's pole vaulting around the room,
and... uh...

111
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:52,280
After the sex, well that's when she
actually knighted me.

112
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:57,020
It was quite ***

113
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,530
Agent Z?

114
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,561
I got a mission for you.

115
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,200
Go down and get me a cup of coffee.

116
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,210
[*Laughs*]

117
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:33,180
That just never gets old.

118
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:37,270
Take these authorization
forms down to the labs,

119
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:40,080
we can finalize testing on formula 69.

120
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,150
I will take that.

121
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:56,650
Ever mean to have a little "chat"
with Amy down in the lab.

122
00:20:56,819 --> 00:20:57,819
It's me to do it.

123
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,800
No. You remember what happened last time
we ventured down to

124
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,650
her little den of iniquity?

125
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,460
Stop thinking about it.

126
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,630
*** you pig.

127
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,009
It's gonna be a catfight.

128
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,870
Where are you, Amy?

129
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,920
You, little slut.

130
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,010
Where are you?

131
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,410
That's right.

132
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:21,190
You better hide.

133
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:25,140
You know who was gonna come down here
and kick some ass.

134
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,160
[*eeeew*]

135
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,341
That's interesting.

136
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,330
Hi!

137
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:41,340
Oh. You're not Amy.

138
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,911
No, uh, Amy's out in the field.

139
00:22:43,911 --> 00:22:46,481
She's collecting samples. She
won't be back until next week.

140
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:48,030
I'm her sister Martha.

141
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,809
Where are your pants?

142
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:54,310
Oh...

143
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,700
I'm working at a top-secret project
called "Formula 69".

144
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,960
Formula 69? All right...

145
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,750
You people are into some
seriously kinky shit down here.

146
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:06,920
Mm-hmm.

147
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:10,030
Well you see we've managed
to isolate a pheromone,

148
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:11,910
that's only detectable to females.

149
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:16,340
And also odorless and colorless.

150
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:19,140
It induces extreme sexual arousal,

151
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,670
and pleasurable endorphins when inhaled.

152
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:24,460
Thus clouding the judgment
of any female.

153
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,220
And when mixed with any
standard men's cologne,

154
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:30,759
it becomes an invaluable tool
to our male agents,

155
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:34,759
to stracke and obtain information
from would be females acids.

156
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,620
Hmmm... hmm.

157
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,400
God how you freaks the same.

158
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,601
Mumbo jumbo.

159
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:43,170
Well...

160
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:47,811
Thank you for the... chemistry lesson there,
Dr No-Pants.

161
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,011
But I think I'll be going back upstairs,

162
00:23:51,011 --> 00:23:53,361
where the sane people work.

163
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,500
[*spray*]

164
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,600
Now you don't really think that
that's gonna...

165
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:02,800
[*Martha laughs nervously*]

166
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,640
I... I... I didn't mean to actually...

167
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:09,550
Cause I'm not really into... aah...

168
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,130
So tell me...

169
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,781
Do you think your wife is
actually murdering Amy,

170
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,000
or just beating her beyond recognition?

171
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:40,960
Just a thought.

172
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:09,860
[*women moanings*]

173
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,030
Come on, come on... ah!

174
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:58,131
Hmm... yeah.

175
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,120
"You're my favourite fucking lab whore",
tell me!

176
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:08,671
You're my favourite fucking lab whore.

177
00:36:15,669 --> 00:36:17,769
Test formula complete.

178
00:36:17,769 --> 00:36:21,239
Subject reacted with optimal results.

179
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:51,941
(Hmmm)

180
00:36:51,941 --> 00:36:53,561
Wow, I see she got to you too.

181
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,630
Buckingham Palace - England

182
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,300
I can't believe it, sir.

183
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:18,730
I've got to pee again.

184
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:21,630
 this

185
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,630
I told you not to drink so much
tea this morning.

186
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:33,380
[*They're smelling something*]

187
00:37:34,229 --> 00:37:35,939
What's that god-awful stench?

188
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,040
God, sir...

189
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,620
I've stepped in dog poop.

190
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:45,870
Oh my...

191
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:47,970
[*steps*]

192
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:49,060
Quick.

193
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,250
Hmm-hmm.

194
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:56,400
What should I do?

195
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:57,689
Lose the shoes, man.

196
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,090
- No!
- Yes, quick, lose the shoes.

197
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:01,180
Hurry up!

198
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,711
In remembrance of *** given and received,

199
00:38:12,711 --> 00:38:17,211
and for outstanding service to
crown and the country,

200
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:19,521
and on behalf of the Commowealth,

201
00:38:19,521 --> 00:38:21,561
I hereby dub thee

202
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,880
Sir Marcus Jacks.

203
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:27,090
You may rise.

204
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,100
[*oooh*]

205
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,060
Agent Z, agent D,

206
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:57,950
there's an important satellite transmission
for you in the control room.

207
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,690
It's the President.

208
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:23,700
(Hello?)

209
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:25,210
Go ahead, Mr President.

210
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:26,270
This is on?

211
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,720
I don't get good reception in my office.

212
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,190
Ah, agents Z and D.

213
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,120
I'd like to congratulate you on the
successful mission,

214
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:40,021
and in capturing that really
really bad guy...

215
00:39:38,359 --> 00:39:44,750
 who's that dudes

216
00:39:40,021 --> 00:39:42,581
... Who's that dude's named, Dick?

217
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:46,571
...and in capturing that really
really bad guy Hussein.

218
00:39:47,531 --> 00:39:50,251
I also want to thank you on
behalf of the American public,

219
00:39:50,251 --> 00:39:53,701
because they would have been very
sad to have been blown up.

220
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,470
It was our pleasure, sir.

221
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,850
As a personal gesture,

222
00:39:58,850 --> 00:40:02,850
I would like to grant you to
the use of my really big boat.

223
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:04,850
And it's a fancy one too,

224
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:07,240
to celebrate your anniversary.

225
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,440
Oh my God!

226
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,540
Thank you Mr President. Sir.

227
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,600
Look at that, Dick,

228
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,040
now that's what I call a missile.

229
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,770
[*flsuhing the toilets*]

230
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:21,640
[*fart*]

231
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,010
Oh my God, do you believe it?

232
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,690
I'm going on a cruise...

233
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:30,750
... on the president's boat!

234
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:32,490
Oh my God.

235
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,380
This is so ***

236
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,260
I never get to go anywhere...

237
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,450
[*indistinct chat*]

238
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,720
- What?
- Who are they?

239
00:40:57,650 --> 00:40:58,860
Well, since you're an agent now,

240
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:00,600
X is auditioning new assistants.

241
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:04,840
He's replacing me?

242
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,850
Uh, pff..

243
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:11,270
This is a top secret mission,

244
00:41:11,450 --> 00:41:13,720
of the utmost importance.

245
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,780
I need for you to take this phone,

246
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:20,200
and answer it whenever I call.

247
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:24,040
If you don't I could be killed.

248
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,730
Do you understand?

249
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,610
He's replacing me.

250
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:52,500
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

251
00:41:59,089 --> 00:42:10,670
okay okay do you understand I understand

252
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:00,660
Okay, okay, okay.

253
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:03,740
Do you understand?

254
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,751
- Understand what?
- [*she laughs*]

255
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:09,270
What was the question again?

256
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,050
(Okay)

257
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:13,600
You're perfect.

258
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:15,530
You're hired.

259
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,700
- Me?
- Me? No, me!

260
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:18,740
No, me!

261
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:20,300
He's talking about me, okay?

262
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:20,950
- Me!
- Me!

263
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:21,660
Hep Hep!

264
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:23,030
Okay, both of you.

265
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:24,530
You're both hired.

266
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:32,561
Stop it.

267
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:33,640
Stop it!

268
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:44,870
[*indistinct chat*]

269
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:54,350
So...

270
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:57,940
You guys are Agent X new
administrative assistants, huh?

271
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:00,850
No, silly, we're secretaries!

272
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:06,610
Unbelievable.

273
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,981
***?
It could have happened to anyone.

274
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,150
But it didn't happen to anyone.

275
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:30,570
It happened to me.

276
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:33,740
I must have keep *** like that.

277
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:45,860
Sir Jacks.

278
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:48,910
Sir Jacks, at your service.

279
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:53,520
Look on the bright side,

280
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:56,370
it's not every day you get into
the Queen's knickers, no? Is it?

281
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,010
Actually she wasn't wearing any, was she?

282
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,080
Come on Tea Biscuit,

283
00:44:03,730 --> 00:44:05,560
let's go slay some dragons.

284
00:44:15,610 --> 00:44:18,930
[*Mission Impossible theme*]

285
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:21,760
(Agent Jacks, agent Watson,)

286
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,730
(do you read? This is agent Q, please respond.)

287
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:39,700
this is Walton we have just intercepted

288
00:44:34,711 --> 00:44:35,761
This is Watson.

289
00:44:35,791 --> 00:44:38,781
(We ave just received a coded transmission)

290
00:44:38,781 --> 00:44:40,781
(Seems that North Korean leader Jong-Il has ***)

291
00:44:40,781 --> 00:44:43,511
(large quantites of unknown substance,)

292
00:44:43,511 --> 00:44:44,681
(for use in a weapon.)

293
00:44:45,372 --> 00:44:46,782
***

294
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,250
(We are not sure.)

295
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:50,900
(But the message allude to an
impending large-scale attack.)

296
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:53,350
(We attract a vessel transport
one of the ships)

297
00:44:53,350 --> 00:44:54,500
(***)

298
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:57,070
(Proceed immediately to *** air force base.)

299
00:44:57,410 --> 00:44:59,090
(your *** is already in route and)

300
00:44:59,090 --> 00:45:00,860
(intelligence waiting to further review)

301
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:02,290
(with ***)

302
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:06,440
(This message will self-destruct in... 5...)

303
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:09,700
(4... 3... 2...)

304
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:11,520
(1...) [*BANG*]

305
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:26,010
I hate when they do that.

306
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:29,110
That's the fourth one this week.

307
00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:31,260
And I wanted some toast tonight.

308
00:45:38,350 --> 00:45:39,900
Now, the mirror on the wall,

309
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:42,020
who's the sexiest of them all?

310
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:01,880
[*beep*]

311
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:04,940
Many pardons, Supreme Commander Sir,

312
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:06,940
the *** is here to see you.

313
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:11,330
Oh... have a wait in my office.

314
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:19,010
I'm so sexy.

315
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:21,890
She not resist me this time.

316
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:28,960
Ah...

317
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:32,600
Jung-Ho... What a pleasure.

318
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:39,520
Sorry for the interruption, Commander,

319
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:42,670
I was sent to informing that
Dr Kwan has arrived safely,

320
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:44,760
and is now working on your formula.

321
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,900
He's guaranteed me he'll
have results shortly.

322
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:49,280
Excellent.

323
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:53,100
Wacky americans keep searching
for nuclear weapons.

324
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,300
They will never suspect this.

325
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:58,100
I so smart!
I genius!

326
00:46:58,470 --> 00:46:59,390
Genius!

327
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:04,100
Tell Dr Kwan he has exactly 24 hours.

328
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,900
General So-Hung will be joining you to
oversee completion of the attack.

329
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:12,320
Oh, Yung-Ho?

330
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:14,810
Shall we make with the sex?

331
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:19,600
Yung-Ho?

332
00:47:19,850 --> 00:47:22,170
Oh... You play hard-to-get?
Alrighty!

333
00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:23,470
I've been stretching.

334
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:24,570
[*ouch*]

335
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:26,180
Yung-Ho?

336
00:47:26,911 --> 00:47:27,901
Yung-Ho?

337
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:47,210
From now on...

338
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,600
...you're gonna be known as agents...

339
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:52,890
... "T"...

340
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:56,530
... and "A".

341
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
You know it is a terrible thing, though,

342
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:07,410
to think that you may not come
back from one of these missions.

343
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:09,250
[*ooooh*]

344
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:13,300
I'm sorry...

345
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:15,960
I'm okay though.

346
00:48:17,350 --> 00:48:20,120
'Cause it's just something
that I, CIA agents,

347
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:21,811
have to put up with, you know.

348
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:24,810
Wear it like a badge of honor

349
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,640
Still the... thought of never...

350
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:32,350
...have a look or touch you again...

351
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:36,850
I'm alright...

352
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:41,700
(No no, we can like that, eternally...)

353
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:42,730
No...

354
00:48:46,650 --> 00:48:50,371
(No... we can...)

355
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:08,870
Ouch, hold it!

356
00:49:10,830 --> 00:49:12,090
Okay, okay...

357
00:49:15,050 --> 00:49:17,360
Ladies, there is enough of agent X...

358
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:19,180
...to pull around.

359
00:49:19,810 --> 00:49:21,150
(yeah...)

360
00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:23,230
...and... listen...

361
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:24,750
if you're gonna be a team...

362
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:27,800
We're gonna see how you...

363
00:49:28,610 --> 00:49:30,610
You know... work to...

364
00:49:31,610 --> 00:49:32,850
together.

365
00:59:34,890 --> 00:59:37,890
[*Jaws theme*]

366
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:01,260
[*Laughs*]

367
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:18,850
[*Laughs*]

368
01:00:28,230 --> 01:00:29,100
Ah!

369

I'm close.

372
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:45,530
I'm close.

373
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:46,870
I just need more time.

374
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:50,180

01:12:42,950 --> 01:12:45,560
but I can't find any sort of structures.

408
01:12:45,750 --> 01:12:48,310

enough to store weapons.

What I don't get is
how the doctors

is how the doctors
were able to fix your

tiny crooked little dick,

anything for your pea brain.

I'm still not sure how you intend

481
01:19:00,250 --> 01:19:03,570

to just poison themselves.

01:32:29,379 --> 01:32:31,659
one can survive if we have food,

516
01:32:31,659 --> 01:32:33,809

01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:54,000
Are you on the mission?

555
01:36:55,700 --> 01:36:56,339
Yeah...

556
01:36:57,450 --> 01:36:58,550
[whispering:] What mission?

557
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:01,050
I don't know, he doesn't tell me anything.

558
01:37:01,350 --> 01:37:02,120
Oh...

559
01:37:02,300 --> 01:37:04,250
Okay, I think it's clear.

560
01:37:04,250 --> 01:37:05,730
Let's move. Quick. Let's move.

561
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:18,360
You, uh, do likely be needing these.

562
01:37:18,820 --> 01:37:19,640
Thanks.

563
01:37:21,850 --> 01:37:22,620
So...

564
01:37:23,300 --> 01:37:25,450
You're really Sir Jacks now, huh?

565
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:27,480
I can't believe you guys got knighted.

566
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:28,920
Oh... hum...

567
01:37:29,200 --> 01:37:31,001
Well, one of us did,

568
01:37:31,001 --> 01:37:33,180
but things didn't go quite
as planned for Watson.

569
01:37:35,300 --> 01:37:36,100
Really?

570
01:37:36,830 --> 01:37:37,760
What happened?

571
01:37:39,900 --> 01:37:41,420
I don't want to talk about it, okay?

572
01:37:41,420 --> 01:37:43,860
Sir *** keep rubbing it in my face.

573
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:45,170
(Don't be so sensitive, man)

574
01:37:45,500 --> 01:37:47,380
Let's just brief Rachel now, would you?

575
01:37:52,700 --> 01:37:54,520
Well, as you know, this
island is the smallest

576
01:37:54,520 --> 01:37:56,810
of the group belonging to
North Korean leader, Jong-Il.

577
01:37:58,000 --> 01:37:59,521
Now a British intel has informed us

578
01:37:59,521 --> 01:38:02,681
that he has hidden some sort of
weapon here in preparing for attack.

579
01:38:04,450 --> 01:38:06,560
We've been using satelite imagery

580
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:10,530
to scan the terrain for any
photographic element of anything

581
01:38:10,530 --> 01:38:13,860
man-made existing out here.

582
01:38:15,950 --> 01:38:20,930
So we began searching the island on
for 2 days ago, thinking perhaps

583
01:38:20,930 --> 01:38:24,640
Jong-Il had stashed the weapons in a cave.

584
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:27,150
But so far, we've had no luck.

585
01:38:27,250 --> 01:38:27,920
Hmmm.

586
01:38:29,350 --> 01:38:32,190
Have you guys consider the
possibility that maybe it's underground?

587
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:35,950
- No...
- [*Jacks toughs*]

588
01:38:35,950 --> 01:38:37,990
Um, I mean, yes.

589
01:38:45,550 --> 01:38:46,450
Here.

590
01:38:46,650 --> 01:38:50,280
I'll hack into one of the
US heat-seeking satellite,

591
01:38:50,280 --> 01:38:52,680
reposition it to scan this island,

592
01:38:52,680 --> 01:38:54,210
see what we can find.

593
01:39:06,200 --> 01:39:06,800
Wow...

594
01:39:08,100 --> 01:39:09,490
You really did the..

595
01:39:09,490 --> 01:39:11,949
on your top secret clearance now, didn't you?

596
01:39:14,100 --> 01:39:15,500
Could you doubt me, sir Jacks?

597
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:18,980
Never again, my dear.
Never again.

598
01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:23,500
Look, it's working...

599
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:25,290
Goog god.

600
01:39:26,100 --> 01:39:27,810
It's been been right
beneath us the whole time.

601
01:39:28,600 --> 01:39:32,289
It appears to be about a *** of us.

602
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:37,131
- Oh my god.
- What?

603
01:39:37,131 --> 01:39:38,511
We have to tell George.

604
01:39:39,150 --> 01:39:40,000
George?

605
01:39:40,650 --> 01:39:42,840
George, yes! Where is he, old chap?

606
01:39:50,100 --> 01:39:51,990
Oh, nice!

607
01:39:52,500 --> 01:39:54,960
Very nice. Look at these statues.

608
01:39:57,950 --> 01:39:59,010
Very nice.

609
01:39:59,810 --> 01:40:01,120
Wonderful place.

610
01:40:03,259 --> 01:40:05,739
Ouch, ah. Oh that was painful.

611
01:40:05,569 --> 01:40:06,739
Oh, thank you.

612
01:40:07,200 --> 01:40:09,420
Thank you very much, but
I could have walked.

613
01:40:09,420 --> 01:40:10,810
There was a woo...

614
01:40:22,500 --> 01:40:23,700
Ouh!

615
01:40:30,750 --> 01:40:32,350
Oh, hey, woo... Time out!

616
01:40:32,350 --> 01:40:33,950
Time out. Hold on. Time out.

617
01:40:33,950 --> 01:40:36,440
Time out. Woo, secret wedding ring.

618
01:40:36,651 --> 01:40:38,811
I know it's means something
to some people but

619
01:40:38,811 --> 01:40:39,901
to other people it means nothing,

620
01:40:39,901 --> 01:40:42,571
but to me I love Rachel.

621
01:40:42,591 --> 01:40:44,212
Whoa. Rachel? Rachel?

622
01:40:44,212 --> 01:40:45,873
Loving Rachel. Loving Rachel. Whoa.

623
01:40:45,873 --> 01:40:47,163
Something else is up beside Rachel.

624
01:40:47,163 --> 01:40:48,293
Hello?

625
01:40:49,700 --> 01:40:52,740
Okay, wow, let's skip it...

626
01:40:53,100 --> 01:40:54,080
Stop it.

627
01:40:54,080 --> 01:40:55,640
Stop it, I'm getting wood.

628
01:40:56,850 --> 01:40:57,790
Woah, getting wood...

629
01:40:59,450 --> 01:41:01,820
Okay, okay. Just a little bit.

630
01:41:02,750 --> 01:41:04,390
All right, just a little bit.

631
01:41:06,650 --> 01:41:07,800
Okay, okay, okay,

632
01:41:08,100 --> 01:41:10,109
all right? I wouldn't want to be rude.

633
01:50:41,870 --> 01:50:44,990
One of the security details found
an intruder on the beach.

634
01:50:45,580 --> 01:50:47,750
Oh, would they eliminated?

635
01:50:48,250 --> 01:50:49,591
She escaped.

636
01:50:51,050 --> 01:50:52,760
Son of bitch. Shit.

637
01:50:54,800 --> 01:50:56,340
Have my men ***

638
01:51:56,580 --> 01:51:57,860
[*roar*]

639
01:51:57,900 --> 01:51:59,280
- What is that?
- What is that?

640
01:52:01,200 --> 01:52:02,240
George?

641
01:52:15,100 --> 01:52:15,890
[*roar*]

642
01:52:18,150 --> 01:52:20,340
Don't... move.

643
01:52:22,900 --> 01:52:25,080
Slowly guys. Slowly.

644
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:29,281
- [*roar*]
- Move!

645
01:52:33,100 --> 01:52:35,000
Sir Jacks! ***

646
01:52:49,300 --> 01:52:50,610
Rachel I'm coming.

647
01:53:00,350 --> 01:53:01,490
Oh my god.

648
01:53:02,100 --> 01:53:03,260
Rachel?

649
01:53:06,610 --> 01:53:07,450
What the...?

650
01:53:07,450 --> 01:53:10,170
Agent Jacks? Meet my new friend.

651
01:53:15,350 --> 01:53:16,961
Rachel, how?

652
01:53:18,400 --> 01:53:21,660
Top secret pheromone spray.
Formula 69.

653
01:53:22,150 --> 01:53:23,740
Females find it irresistible.

654
01:53:25,200 --> 01:53:27,710
Obviously the species is not a factor.

655
01:53:27,820 --> 01:53:28,710
I'd say.

656
01:53:28,710 --> 01:53:29,879
- Can I have it?
- No.

657
01:53:30,570 --> 01:53:32,711
Oh... Why?

658
01:53:47,200 --> 01:53:48,600
- Sir?
- What are you doing?

659
01:53:49,400 --> 01:53:51,070
It's no time for siesta Watson.
Come on get up!

660
01:53:51,070 --> 01:53:52,150
(What happened?)

661
01:53:52,730 --> 01:53:54,280
You fainted. That's what happened.

662
01:53:54,600 --> 01:53:55,270
Fainted?

663
01:53:55,270 --> 01:53:57,500
Yes, I told you once,
now I told you twice.

664
01:53:57,500 --> 01:53:58,940
That's one crafty bird.

665
01:53:59,400 --> 01:54:00,050
Come on!

666
01:54:00,770 --> 01:54:01,980
Quickly...

667
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:06,830
That's one crafty bird, Watson.

668
01:54:16,700 --> 01:54:18,000
I don't get it...

669
01:54:18,300 --> 01:54:19,470
Where could he be?

670
01:54:19,720 --> 01:54:21,100
He could be anywhere.

671
01:54:21,100 --> 01:54:23,050
It's George.
He couldn't have gone that far.

672
01:54:23,309 --> 01:54:25,569
- Who knows?
- Have you see the shape he's in?

673
01:54:30,300 --> 01:54:31,220
***

674
01:54:31,600 --> 01:54:32,430
Look!

675
01:54:32,801 --> 01:54:35,571
This is his floaty.
He couldn't have gone far.

676
01:54:36,100 --> 01:54:38,980
- Sir?
- You thought what I think it is?

677
01:54:41,800 --> 01:54:43,041
Cannibals.

678
01:54:43,041 --> 01:54:44,310
Cannibals?

679
01:54:44,650 --> 01:54:46,000
There's cannibals here?

680
01:54:47,900 --> 01:54:49,070
What does that mean for George?

681
01:54:52,250 --> 01:54:53,270
What...

682
01:54:53,650 --> 01:54:54,800
- Sorry...
- What does that mean?

683
01:54:54,800 --> 01:54:55,989
- I'm sorry Rachel.
- Sorry Rachel.

684
01:54:55,989 --> 01:54:56,809
No...

685
01:54:56,809 --> 01:54:58,239
George!

686
01:55:01,900 --> 01:55:02,800
He's...

687
01:55:02,800 --> 01:55:04,630
He doesn't hurt ***. Come on.

688
01:55:04,900 --> 01:55:06,850
Why there's someone who wanna eat George?

689
01:55:09,300 --> 01:55:11,780
Number one: buy new platform shoes.

690
01:55:13,550 --> 01:55:14,260
Check.

691
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,580
Number two: update my my-appraised(?) page.
Yeah, check.

692
01:55:19,340 --> 01:55:21,720
Number three: blew something up.

693
01:55:21,950 --> 01:55:23,240
[*explosion*]

694
01:55:23,900 --> 01:55:24,980
He-he. Check.

695
01:55:26,400 --> 01:55:29,250
Number four: father more illegitimate children...

696
01:55:34,150 --> 01:55:35,630
About to be checked...

697
01:55:37,600 --> 01:55:40,160
Yung-Ho. I need you consider my offer.

698
01:55:40,300 --> 01:55:42,340
We can make beautiful evil offspring together.

699
01:55:42,910 --> 01:55:45,860
Intruders were discovered
in the island, Commander.

700
01:55:46,460 --> 01:55:49,100
Would don't just stand there, looking cute,
with your dragon face in your big cans.

701
01:55:49,100 --> 01:55:50,600
Go get them and destroy them.

702
01:55:54,250 --> 01:55:55,080
Oh wait...

703
01:55:55,950 --> 01:55:58,400
Tell me s sexy thing.

704
01:56:14,700 --> 01:56:17,720
Rachel, I'm sure he knew how
you really felt.

705
01:56:20,900 --> 01:56:22,560
That's what I'm afraid of...

706
01:56:23,700 --> 01:56:24,510
You see,

707
01:56:24,800 --> 01:56:26,300
the last time I saw George,

708
01:56:27,150 --> 01:56:29,230
I hit him with my shoe...

709
01:56:41,300 --> 01:56:42,210
To George.

710
01:56:42,600 --> 01:56:44,190
A gentleman spy.

711
01:56:49,200 --> 01:56:50,709
And a great soldier.

712
01:56:51,500 --> 01:56:53,460
Well... sort of.

713
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:55,960
Rachel,

714
01:56:56,400 --> 01:56:58,671
many comrades fall in ***

715
01:56:59,450 --> 01:57:00,910
It is the nature of our business.

716
01:57:01,500 --> 01:57:03,890
But George died saving his country.

717
01:57:04,700 --> 01:57:06,000
You should be very proud.

718
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:09,470
Hmm, you're cute.

719
01:57:10,150 --> 01:57:13,050
You sound like that little
insurance lizard on the TV.

720
01:57:13,100 --> 01:57:13,670
Huh?

721
01:57:13,670 --> 01:57:15,239
- We should make out.
- What?

722
02:08:41,500 --> 02:08:43,860
Oh, I do love a natural woman.

723
02:08:43,860 --> 02:08:46,789

02:08:46,789 --> 02:09:00,239
