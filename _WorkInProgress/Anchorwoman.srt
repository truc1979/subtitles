Wszyscy wiedzą,

271
01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:24,900
...hormony, które przez nią przebiegają,
hormones running through it that make you unstable and irrational

01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:39,600
this is a huge responsibility

277
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:41,600
I don't even know why even bother talking news

278
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:43,600
like talking to a rock

279
01:16:44,020 --> 01:16:44,780
Boże!

280
01:16:44,780 --> 01:16:48,360
Wiesz, myślę że ta nowość przeminie,
 you know I think the novelty will wear off and then come to it's senses

281
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:50,040
I wouldn't bet on that Don

282
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:53,780
Wygląda na to, że mamy ogromny skok oglądalności,
looks like a huge spike in ratings because Angela is here

283
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:55,620

01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:06,960

Zanurzył bym twarz między tymi ciasteczkami

291
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:25,240
careful sailor

292
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:27,240

01:17:38,580 --> 01:17:39,820
i don't know

295
01:17:39,820 --> 01:17:42,880
Myślę, że jest trochę słodki,
I think it's kinda cute, in a retarded way

296
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:46,840
Widzisz,
see, it's thinking exactly that's holding us back in our careers

297
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:52,860
Jesteśmy urocze i nieszkodliwe, musimy zatrzymać mężczyzn,
we need stopping the men, is cute and harmless, if we want to break through the glass ceiling they have over us

298
01:17:53,260 --> 01:17:55,960
Sama nie wiem.
i don't know we're still women right

299
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:57,360
i mean

300
01:17:57,640 --> 01:18:00,340
I saw how you were looking at it when you sat Don

301
01:18:00,340 --> 01:18:03,080
I saw you were fantasizing about him

302
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:05,080
you were practically drooling

303
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:09,340
Przyznaję, myślałam, że jest niesamowity,
I'll admit I thought he was super dreaming when I first started

304
01:18:09,340 --> 01:18:13,120
Ale kiedy go poznałam i okazał się totalnym fiutem,
but once I met him, it was dick is, that completely went away

305
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:15,640
that's true

306
01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:19,640
Ale gdybyśmy im się stawiały,
but if we held that against them, we'd never get laid

307
01:18:20,180 --> 01:18:21,440
yeah right

308
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:24,500
ladies let's just put this all behind us

309
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:27,520
and go celebrate these awesome ratings

310
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:29,660

311
01:18:29,660 --> 01:18:30,340

01:18:30,340 --> 01:18:32,340

313
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:41,000
Okej, przyznaję,
okay I'll admit I've had a crush on Don Merlo for a while

314
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
but I didn't realize who is such a dick

315
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
made quite a first impression

316
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:46,620
don't let him get to you

317
01:18:46,740 --> 01:18:49,000

01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:50,380

01:18:50,380 --> 01:18:52,180
 You'll get used to it we all did

320
01:18:52,620 --> 01:18:57,160
Kiedy mnie zatrudnili, myślałam,
when they first hired me I thought I was going to be the first female reporter on the field

321
01:18:57,160 --> 01:18:58,740
but now I'm just rayan assistance

322
01:18:58,740 --> 01:19:01,280

323
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:04,440

324
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:07,040
Co myślicie,

325
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:09,520
