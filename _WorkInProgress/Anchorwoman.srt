ANCHORWOMAN
A XXX PARODY

6
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,740
1975, Los Angeles

7
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,180
Well, pretty lady...

8
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,180
...looks like you've got all the...

9
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,960
...proper qualifications for the job.

10
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,920
- So, only one problem.
- What's that?

11
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,260
You're a woman.

12
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,980
Yeah we've never had a...

13
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:51,100
...female anchor here at channel 6 news...

14
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:54,960
I don't think now is the time to start.

15
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,580
I'm a lot more than a woman,
I'm a journalist...

16
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:00,600
...and times are changing, Ned,
and channel 6 needs to change with them.

17
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,400
Look...
I'm familiar with what happened down in San Diego.

18
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,800
But up here, it's a different market.

19
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:10,520
In our viewers are used to us delivering a solid product.

20
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,080
What does that mean?

21
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,380
Look...

22
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,040
I'm sorry you know there's nothing I can do for you at this time

23
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,060
You know, it's a shame too because,
you know...

24
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:23,060
You're... you're... your beautiful women, you know.

25
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:27,720
Remind me a lot of an ex-girlfriend of mine in college and...

26
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,800
She was a dreamer.

27
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:34,100
I'm not leaving until you give me one good reason
as to why i can't deliver the news as well as a man.

28
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,720
I give you two:

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,520
Those juicy and melons are flying out of your...

30
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,520
...bra right there.
I mean...

31
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,720
God!
How is anybody supposed to concentrate...

32
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,180
...watching the news when you got sweet puppies just...

33
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,700
...in their face.

34
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,220
You mean these titties?

35
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:58,000
Sweet baby Jesus, those things are nice.

36
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,280
Well, I'm glad you're enjoying the view.

37
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:10,500
A powerful man like yourself, should have the best seat in the house.

38
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:15,360
Uh... What were we talking about?

39
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,160
I think you were saying, how channel 6 news...

40
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:24,800
...was finally ready to bring on their first female anchor isn't that right?

41
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,320
well, I, you know, I mean, we haven't talked about adding

42
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,400
...a little diversity to the station...

43
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,380
But you know, I mean...

44
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:40,180
I can get a lot of trouble and hot water over it, I mean, searing....

45
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:43,640
is there anything else, maybe, you could do to convince me?

46
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,220
Well

47
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:50,260
How about you put me on for 1 week during prime time?

48
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:55,780
I'll make your ratings go up and I'll also give you the best fuck of your life

49
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,280
Alright

50
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,860
One week, but...

51
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:04,120
Don't get all upset when you fail and I have to...

52
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,560
fire you and all that stuff, I know how emotional you brat can get

53
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,000
You have to promise me...

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
...if the ratings go up...

55
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,480
you'll keep me on during prime time

56
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,480
Allright, it's a deal

57
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,120
I mean you literally got me by the balls right now

58
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,700
but, I can get catch hell for this,
I mean

59
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:27,900
The owner as far he's concerned women belong in the kitchen

60
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,620
I was the one responsible for hire all most of the... you know...

61
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,620
female employees here

62
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,780
Well

63
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:39,300
I promise you, that thinking progressively has its benefits and you won't regret it

64
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,440
Oh god

65
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,620
Here's the progressive thinking

66
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,440
- Oh my good, you want me to come?
- Yeah I do.

67
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,060
You wanna come on my pretty face?

68
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:07,220
This just in breaking news so hot

69
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:10,780
it will literally melt your television set.

70
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:14,700
so I hope you have two television sets

71
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,620
I'm Don Merlot,

72
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:19,460
and tonight I'm going to take you

73
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:22,380
inside to the dragon.

74
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:26,580
A topic so shrouded in mystery

75
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,120
That I am the only man on this planet, who can tell it properly

76
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:35,220
Now I know most of my viewers at home

77
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:39,540
- Who's he talking to? There's someone else?
- Quiet, quiet. Professional speaking here.

78
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:43,360
I know most of my viewers at home

79
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,860
thinking that what they're about to see is going to be

80
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:48,680
awesome and mind-blowing. And it is.

81
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:52,780
but let me assure you I'm a professional journalist so it is my duty to warn you

82
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,960
the images that you're about to see

83
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,320
are sexually graphic in nature

84
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,320
and disgusting

85
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,320
and possibly racist

86
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,760
as I'm a

87
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,620
46 year old white man with a young Asian woman

88
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,620
So...

89
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,620
God Bless America

90
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,760
and buy savings bonds.

91
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,400
Well my Lady,

92
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:37,780
I have to say it was quite fun

93
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:39,580
but

94
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:41,060
i have to

95
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:44,140
- ...go.
- Where are you going, Don?

96
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:47,060
well...

97
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,060
in the real world,

98
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,540
I do something very special:

99
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:56,020
I deliver the news to millions of people each night.

100
00:45:56,020 --> 00:46:01,760
I am the voice of trust and reason

101
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:03,760
I am...

102
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,760
...Don Merlot.

103
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:11,140
I'm gonna use your jacuzzi to wash, before I leave

104
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,110
so, don't lock up behind you.

105
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:32,700
Can I just say what an honor it is to work with you on the news tonight.

106
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:36,080
Hmm don't get used to it, sister

107
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:40,380
One slip-up and you'll be on that fantastic ass looking for a man.

108
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:41,780
take care of you.

109
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:43,780
What did you just say?

110
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:46,520
Oh you heard me sugar tits, this is a man's job.

111
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:50,080
You think having a fantastic rack qualifies you to read the news?

112
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:52,940
Next week you'll be filing unemployment.

113
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:55,340
It's Channel 6 News

114
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:58,840
with your beloved, award-winning anchor, Don Merlot.

115
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:00,840
Good evening,  this is 6 o'clock news

116
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:04,100
- I'm Don Merlot
- And I'm Angela Fontana.

117
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:09,660
and keeping up with the stories are developing tonight in your world

118
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:13,780
a South Bay Area man is intensive care after being

119
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:16,680
bumped by two sea lions at a local

120
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:20,260
taco gym parking lot. On the story as it develops.

121
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:22,760
Ass, cash or grass?

122
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:26,780
As Americans are panicking over the most recent gas crisis in America

123
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:29,600
we give you great alternatives for transportation.

124
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:34,760
And could the lights in the produce section of your local grocery store be giving you brain cancer?

125
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:39,000
We'll have the answer at the end of the show, but first let's check in with our men on the field.

126
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:43,020
I'm Ryan Shasta. Pickup lines, do they work?

127
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:48,100
Been out here, the most popular jogging spot, after hours trying out new ones,

128
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:51,140
and I'm fairly certain I've narrowed it down to 10

129
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:54,360
watch I try them out

130
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:56,200
It says here you're a cheap.

131
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:59,840
or a dirty butthole, who likes to handjob in bus station.

132
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:03,640
Well you smell like dirty balls and red-hot.

133
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:11,560
That's actually my new cologne is called to 2-1 nights. It's an aphrodisiac. They actually put Spanish fly in it.

134
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:13,220
Are you feeling it?

135
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:16,320
Pretty soon, you're gonna be begging to gobble mine up. 

136
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:19,160
You know I can give you a pearl necklace to go through those cheap earrings.

137
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:25,240
As tempting as that sounds, I would rather blow a homeless man, and put that shriveled-up dick in my mouth.

138
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:29,660
That's kinky, I would actually pay this. No joke.

139
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:34,520
This is a disaster. What are you thinking?

140
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:37,380
You said we need a gimmick to pique your interest.

141
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:39,480
Besides she's got great tits. I mean,

142
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:40,620
she's good I can.

143
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:42,620
What I meant, was like: get somebody

144
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:44,280
who was like a trained monkey

145
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:47,580
who could read their headlines. Not put some woman on the news.

146
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:49,820
How is this any different?

147
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:52,460
I hope you know what you're doing.

148
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:57,460
Ok, I gotta go take my heart medicine. My pressure is through the roof.

149
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:00,300
I anything should go wrong,

150
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:02,300
you'll be out on your ass.

151
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:05,480
Hey pretty lady,

152
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:06,680
what's your favorite number?

153
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:09,020
Oh wait, might 69, get it?

154
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:11,020
I love to get back. You know what I mean.

155
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:13,020
***

156
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:15,020
You're funny. What's your name?

157
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:17,720
My name's Jack Me-Off. I mean, Jack Hawk.

158
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:18,680
Want to see it?

159
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:20,280
That's hilarious.

160
00:49:20,370 --> 00:49:22,680
- I think we should go out
- Sure

161
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:27,420
Nailed it. For Channel 6 news, I'm Ryan Shasta. Back to you Don.

162
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:29,420
Compelling stuff.

163
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:31,420
Now over to the weather.

164
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:32,800
Thanks Don.

165
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:37,060
I'm Rick Stormwatch, with your official local updates.

166
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:40,160
Prepare to see temperatures in the mid-80s throughout the week,

167
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:45,800
With some chilly overnight lows dipping down into the low 70s. 71 to be exact.

168
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:47,340
Back to you guys.

169
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:50,680
Any suggestions as to what the viewer should wear this week?

170
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:53,300
Well Angela, if they look anything like you...

171
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:55,660
...less is better!

172
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:57,900
Good one, Rick!

173
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:02,400
Let's head over to make burgers sports desk and check in with Jack.

174
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:06,080
What now is the point of having ***?

175
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:13,060
You take the top teams from the National League, you're playing against the top teams from the American League, and that's it.

176
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:19,780
But instead you let those damn gay babe greasy pricks into this league, they steal the whole fucking thing.

177
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:25,340
And I'm the one that gets dejected from the third base, ***.

178
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:27,620
You son of a bitch, it's not fucking over.

179
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:30,720
It's not fucking over, you hear me you son of a bitch?

180
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:32,720
Okay, okay,

181
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:37,060
another fascinating look at the world of family friendly sports,

182
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:39,060
with Tiger Jack.

183
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:40,820
Good work, Jack.

184
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:46,860
So we are all loaded up?

185
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:48,080
No.

186
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:50,480
No, thanks to you Ryan.

187
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,840
You know you could give a hand every once in a while?

188
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:55,200
Look, I'm the on-air talent.

189
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:57,660
There's one thing and one thing only:

190
00:50:57,660 --> 00:50:59,660
I don't lift heavy objects.

191
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:01,660
This is with my unit.

192
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:03,660
And I prefer if you help me with that.

193
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:06,220
Where's the jogger you picked up earlier?

194
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:08,220
I turnt it down for you.

195
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:11,160
Now what you say? We'll go full round in that van again?

196
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:12,220
Listen.

197
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:16,020
I only jerked you off that one time, because you said my tits were giving you blue balls.

198
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:18,340
Not so we can hook up in the van every time.

199
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:22,520
Look I already know there's some raw animal magnetism at work.

200
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:24,520
Alright? Why fight it?

201
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:28,960
You told me you're going to get me in front of the camera with you,

202
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,540
i did this to become a reporter.

203
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:33,440
Not so I could be in command of jerking you off all the time Ryan.

204
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,040
Relax, cookie pussy.

205
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:37,040
Alright? I've already talked to Ned.

206
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:38,400
You done?

207
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:39,660
what did you say?

208
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:41,660
Well, I hate to break it to you but

209
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:44,620
he said there's no chicks

210
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:46,040
in the news

211
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:49,160
Then he said get your head out of your ass and threw a drink at me.

212
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:50,600
Kind of a rush.

213
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:53,880
There's a chick doing the news right now. You have to go tell them.

214
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:55,880
I will, sexy mom, alright.

215
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:57,880
But I'm gonna need more than a tug

216
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:59,880
if I'm going to war for you, my secret lover.

217
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:03,320
Fine. But you tell your friends

218
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,580
I'll deny it.

219
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:09,140
I can live with that. Now hop in that van. Wait, wait. In a kinkier way.

220
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,320
That's what I'm talking about.

221
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:21,750
(Fuck)

222
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:26,460
Technical difficulties. Please remain docile. God Bless America.

223
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:32,220
Hum, are you sure this is okay?

224
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:34,220
Oh don't you worry baby.

225
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:37,140
You just relax, I'm gonna take a look place is alright.

226
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:38,660
Just sit back.

227
00:52:38,850 --> 00:52:40,660
- Yeah, alright, here we go.
- Okay.

228
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:42,380
Well, what if somebody comes in?

229
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:44,380
Doesn't matter. Doesnt' matter.

230
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:47,080
We take you on a journey, alright?

231
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:48,710
Yeah.

232
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:54,600
Interns gotta earn extra credit.

233
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:57,250
- Oh...
- That's it.

234
00:53:04,970 --> 00:53:07,400
- Mustache tickles...
- A little bit?

235
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:10,970
It's a flavor saver.

236
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:13,740
What does that mean?

237
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:15,440
It means I'm going to take care of business.

238
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:16,740
- Wow
- Oh yeah.

239
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:20,490
It's business time.

240
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:24,060
A little dusty in here, but

241
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:25,660
that's why I brought my "womb-brow"

242
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:27,660
Oh my...

243
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:30,980
- Oh, your moustache you mean.
- That's it.

244
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:32,980
I get jokes.

245
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:42,980
Now that's what you've earned.

246
00:54:23,950 --> 00:54:25,060
- Hey!
- What?

247
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:26,300
You don't touch these hair.

248
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,680
That's a golden rule on this.

249
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:30,000
Sorry, sorry.

250
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:32,090
Nobody touches that hair.

251
00:55:43,070 --> 00:55:46,580
Thank you. I feel like a winner.

252
00:56:14,990 --> 00:56:17,810
You have such a strong tongue.

253
00:56:55,090 --> 00:56:58,070
- It's business too.
- Oh it's business.

254
00:57:03,950 --> 00:57:06,950
- There we go, let's see what we got here.
- What do I have?

255
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:59,900
- America.
- I've been there.

256
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:02,250
- You're here now.
- Cool

257
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,400
I'm a patreon, now here's the flag.

258
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:27,460
There we go, get that flagpole up.

259
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:27,240
There we go, that's how you raise it.

260
01:02:00,710 --> 01:02:04,260
- That's kind of romantic
- No, there's no romance in this

261
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:05,740
Okay, well whatever you were.

262
01:09:45,950 --> 01:09:47,930
We almost went to brown town.

263
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:52,070
You're so funny, you're the funniest.

264
01:13:30,750 --> 01:13:32,731
- You learned that trick?
- I don't know.

265
01:13:32,940 --> 01:13:34,700
I used to be a dancer.

266
01:13:36,950 --> 01:13:40,320
I thought you were. I'm gonna go to that strip club.

267
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:43,580
Oh god, you're funny, you're so funny.

268
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:02,060

01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:10,760
- Ok, thank you.
- Don't flip side.

272
01:15:10,850 --> 01:15:11,700
I'm signing out.

273
01:15:11,820 --> 01:15:15,100

I saw how you were looking at it when you sat Don

323
01:18:00,340 --> 01:18:03,080
I saw you were fantasizing about him

324
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:05,080
you were practically drooling

325
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:09,340
PrzyznajÄ™, myÅ›laÅ‚am, Å¼e jest niesamowity,
I'll admit I thought he was super dreaming when I first started

326

Ale kiedy go poznaÅ‚am i okazaÅ‚ siÄ™ totalnym fiutem,
but once I met him, it was dick is, that completely went away

327
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:15,640
that's true

328
01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:19,640
Ale gdybyÅ›my im siÄ™ stawiaÅ‚y,

Okej, przyznajÄ™,
okay I'll admit I've had a crush on Don Merlo for a while

336
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
but I didn't realize who is such a dick

337
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
made quite a first impression

338
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:46,620
