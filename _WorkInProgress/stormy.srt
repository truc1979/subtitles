00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:27,640
Congratulations on becoming agent Rachel

2
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:31,510
I knew you had it in you

3
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,270
Unfortunate about your husband

4
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:32,090
Yes

5
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:35,890
Well, I could not let my feelings for George
compromise the mission

6
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:57,900
Oh... Sorry

7
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,301
Sorry!

8
00:04:13,401 --> 00:04:14,641
Sorry...

9
00:05:10,641 --> 00:05:11,700
Nice tits

10
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:16,590
Does your husband appreciate this?

11
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:21,130
No... Husband doesn't appreciate anything

12
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:23,890
Bull(***?)

13
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:27,089
Dead fool(***?)

14
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:30,909
Ah, George never does that

15
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,000
George couldn't even make coffee

16
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:17,740
*** fucking secret-agent *** feels like

17
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,740
Yeah

18
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,750
- You can't teach that on training
- No

19
00:08:25,159 --> 00:08:27,269
I don't need that anymore

20
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:17,330
George never makes me come

21
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:19,010
George is a fool

22
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:00,475
No evidence

23
00:13:00,475 --> 00:13:02,940
Mission complete

24
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
- Ah!
(- Ah)

25
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,420
- Ah!
- Ah!

26
00:13:09,419 --> 00:13:11,200
Jesus Christ

27
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,260
George you scared the crap out of me

28
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,969
Yeah? You should see it from my point of view

29
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,760
Dreamed about that damn fish tank again?

30
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,910
Yeah. Things like that.

31
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,620
Thank you

32
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,160
Oh I have my cereal

33
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:18,190
Oh you think so?

34
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,109
Yeah. I do.

35
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,150
You feeling lucky?

36
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,650
Would you try to come take it?

37
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,731
Oh, I will

38
00:16:42,135 --> 00:16:46,170
You call yourself a secret agent,

39
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,450
no wonder they won't give you a promotion

40
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,600
Argh

41
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,001
Holly bitch

42
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:21,110
Hey, *** together

43
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:31,300
I take it as a "no"

44
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,640
Ladies first

45
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,210
Age before beauty

46
00:17:50,281 --> 00:17:52,411
Brains before stupidity

47
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,000
What I meant was you're the stupid one, ok?
(- Idiot)

48
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:05,470
(I'm the smart one.
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT)

49
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:07,290
I ***

50
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,100
Everybody knows that

51
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,440
No

52
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,980
Oh...

53
00:18:34,229 --> 00:18:35,539
Oh no

54
00:18:39,459 --> 00:18:41,978
Oh yeah, you want some of this

55
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,700
[composing phone number]

56
00:18:44,859 --> 00:18:47,439
[phone rings]
I *** you like a readheaded stepchild

57
00:18:50,409 --> 00:18:51,869
Oh no you didn't!

58
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,150
Can't believe you stick my spot

59
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:59,210
Oh, is this your spot?

60
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,210
You're dirty. You're dirty. Damn it.

61
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,320
(Hi Rachel)

62
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,990
Morning fellows

63
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:41,120
(Good morning)

64
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,070
I made brownies!

65
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:52,500
Who wnats some?

66
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,060
You don't have to do that I had

67
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,650
I had to park 4 blocks away

68
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:10,280
Well. Now you've had your cardio.

69
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,290
Those are the last of the brownies, isn't it?

70
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:16,730
I didn't even get one

71
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:21,030
Oh, honey... you have to watch your girlish figure

72
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:22,960
It's not fair Rachel

73
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,811
You know I wanted a brownie

74
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,140
George: life's not fair

75
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,490
That's one hell of a woman

76
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:33,290
One hell of a good cook yeah well you

77
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,470
Yeah, well,

78
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:36,070
you try being married to her for 6 years

79
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,190
(SEVEN!)

80
00:20:37,991 --> 00:20:41,691
I'm sorry the lack of sex is making my memory blurry

81
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:47,730
[beep]

82
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,230
Sorry you got to remove all metal from your pockets

83
00:20:58,181 --> 00:20:59,582
[beep]

84
00:20:59,582 --> 00:21:00,853
All metal

85
00:21:08,332 --> 00:21:09,032
[beep]

86
00:21:09,032 --> 00:21:10,522
So we're gonna do a more thorough

87
00:21:10,522 --> 00:21:11,032
Ah!

88
00:21:12,392 --> 00:21:15,482
Sam, it's time for a deep body cavity search

89
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,660
(So there I was...)

90
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:33,010
...surrounded by the enemy...

91
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:35,100
...deep in the jungles of Bolivia...

92
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:38,030
...unarmed and then suddenly I...

93
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,810
Agent Z?

94
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:42,640
Yes Sir

95
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,890
You're late

96
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:50,050
Yes Sir, there was a malfunction at security

97
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:51,850
*** Sir.

98
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:53,259
- Malfunction...?
- Yeah

99
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:56,300
I'll tell you what...

100
00:21:57,479 --> 00:21:59,699
I've got a big mission for you

101
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,600
What?

102
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:05,111
(Yes Sir)

103
00:22:05,879 --> 00:22:08,499
Go down to the break room

104
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,750
and give me a cup of coffee

105
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,740
[laughs]

106
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,900
You know how I like it

107
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:26,480
As I was saying, bullets buzzing over my head

108
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,700
I had no weapon

109
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:30,710
Suddenly, from the canopy above,
came the enemy: *zeeee*

110
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,001
- Hi!
- Argh!

111
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:53,780
Oh... Hi Amy

112
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:58,321
Ah, sorry, I didn't mean to startle you

113
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:01,970
No, it's okay, it's a middle of on edge(***?)

114
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,350
Too much caffeine

115
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,100
Well, I must compliment you on your cat-like reflexes

116
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,419
Oh...

117
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:14,169
Yeah, I was... uh...

118
00:23:14,169 --> 00:23:16,640
Comes with being a secret agent

119
00:23:17,769 --> 00:23:19,999
I'll have to be a little bit more careful around you

120
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:24,579
I didn't know you could be so... dangerous

121
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,390
Yeah, that's... that's me: dangerous

122
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:31,480
You know you could lose an eye

123
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:32,940
[laughs]

124
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,510
Hmm... Speaking of danger,
I have something to show you

125
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:39,510
Won't you come in?

126
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,340
How... cool!

127
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:23,429
(Wow)

128
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:29,081
[amazed laughs]

129
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,380
This is cool!

130
00:24:35,581 --> 00:24:37,051
What does this do?

131
00:24:37,051 --> 00:24:38,881
Oh, be careful with that,

132
00:24:38,881 --> 00:24:40,841
I'm having a lot of problems with it

133
00:24:40,841 --> 00:24:41,000
[George's smelling]

134
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,061
It contains nerve gas, but it keeps leaking

135
00:25:09,639 --> 00:25:12,061
A mini supercomputer

136
00:25:12,061 --> 00:25:15,111
Complete. With wireless internet

137
00:25:15,111 --> 00:25:17,631
Digital camera

138
00:25:17,631 --> 00:25:19,691
MP3 player

139
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:23,490
Cigarette lighter. Even an AM/FM radio

140
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,080
Can I have it?

141
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,631
No

142
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:34,110
What's this?

143
00:25:35,388 --> 00:25:37,110
Um...

144
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:39,740
That's...

145
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:43,960
That's... That's my vibrator

146
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,330
So you're planning on doing a little fly-fishing?

147
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:50,789
Oh that?

148
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,850
That is my pride and joy

149
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:54,280
It's impenetrable

150
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,660
Watch

151
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,879
[gunshot]

152
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:01,351
Wow!

153
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,280
You're crazy

154
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:12,190
Watch this

155
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:15,910
[sound of arrow]

156
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:22,299
Okay, I get it.

157
00:26:23,299 --> 00:26:24,750
This vest is specially designed

158
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,880
to increase the adrenaline and

159
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,440
testosterone of its wearer

160
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,870
giving him more strength, endurance

161
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:33,880
even enabling him to run faster

162
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,350
Well you think he could have made it
a little bit more fashionable

163
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:39,180
I mean it looks like a fishing vest

164
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,430
Do I look like I know anything about fashion?

165
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,890
Oh..! No no no, you know...

166
00:26:47,229 --> 00:26:49,599
No, the vest works. It's um...

167
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:54,020
You know it's just got lots of...
...convenient pockets

168
00:26:55,329 --> 00:26:57,260
It has an internal cooling system

169
00:26:57,260 --> 00:27:00,500
that regulates body temperature
and increases stamina

170
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,600
Imagine what that could do for you under fire

171
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:05,520
Just think what it could do for me in the bedroom

172
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,041
I already have

173
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:15,521
George: [um-um]

174
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:17,912
This is my latest invention:

175
00:27:17,912 --> 00:27:19,232
Training goggles

176
00:27:19,949 --> 00:27:23,519
It can create virtually any situation imaginable

177
00:27:24,269 --> 00:27:24,850
Really?

178
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:27,010
From flying to combat. Try.

179
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:31,440
(Okay)

180
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:37,870
Wow

181
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:46,130
That's cool. You do anything?

182
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:47,350
Anything

183
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:49,970
- Anything?
- Anything.

184
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,570
You want to ***?

185
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,950
You don't know how long it's been

186
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,870
Oh god you're naughty

187
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,000
Oh yes George take it

188
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,610
You know you've always wanted that type
of fucking ass of mine

189
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:24,330
Alright in that tight fucking ass?

190
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:12,490
Okay, that was a little weird

191
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:15,080
You don't know how long I've waited for that

192
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,160
You tricked me!?

193
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:20,000
You lured me down here to take advantage of me

194
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,379
you... you gadget siren

195
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:27,751
Oh... So...?

196
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,500
Oh come on you know I like you

197
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,810
I'm married! ***

198
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:35,950
It wasn't real

199
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,310
Felt real!

200
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,340
Don't! Don't touch me!

201
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,430
Predator

202
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,630
[Rachel's smelling]

203
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,940
Where have you been?

204
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:21,850
Huh? What?

205
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:24,280
You've been gone over an hour

206
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,250
X was looking for you

207
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:27,570
He was?

208
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:30,130
Yeah. He needed his coffee

209
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:32,000
Oh, yeah, right

210
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:35,950
So?

211
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,150
So what?

212
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:39,851
So where were you?

213
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,910
I was taking care of business in the lab

214
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:48,530
Business, huh?

215
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:53,550
And was this "business" wearing a white lab coat

216
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:57,090
and reeking a fake designer perfume?

217
00:36:56,951 --> 00:36:58,500
What are you talking about?

218
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,290
Don't play stupid with me, George

219
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:03,010
That little trollop: Amy 

220
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:04,060
What about her?

221
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:11,360
George I'm serious, I know that you know

222
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:12,000
that she knows that we're having marital issues

223
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:15,150
She's like a vulture waiting on the wings

224
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:18,390
You're a crazy Lady

225
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:20,370
Haha. I'm crazy?

226
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:21,780
I'M CRAZY?

227
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,001
I'm not the one was provoked by
a glass of milk this morning

228
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:28,370
I'm not the one that hassled
the security guards,

229
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,229
and we won't even discuss your bouts
of mourning road rage

230
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:32,580
WHAT??

231
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,250
I did not harass those security guards

232
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:37,500
you set me up, and for your information

233
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,770
they proceeded to get very intimate with me

234
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,580
I guess I should be grateful

235
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:44,280
because it's the closest thing I'm
head to sex in months

236
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,660
There you go again: always with the sex

237
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:51,010
We know what George?
Maybe if you learn a little technique

238
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:53,890
instead of humping me like a drunken Chihuahua

239
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:56,800
I would be a little more willing to participate

240
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,620
- Really?
- Yeah!

241
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:58,839
Really?

242
00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,930
Is there a problem here?

243
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:01,700
Together: NO SIR

244
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,980
Good

245
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:09,090
Rachel, I would like to see you alone, please

246
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,760
Absolutely

247
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:15,450
- Z?
- Yes?

248
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:17,890
- Where's my coffee?
- Coming up, Sir

249
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:22,561
"Where's my coffee?"

250
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,680
Rachel, have a seat

251
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:38,830
I am sitting, Sir

252
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:40,720
Right

253
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:49,160
Rachel, I need you

254
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:52,660
Excuse me?

255
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:55,280
Your help.

256
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,710
Oh

257
00:38:56,970 --> 00:38:59,780
You're the only one that I can trust I

258
00:39:00,809 --> 00:39:02,319
I have to go on a secret mission

259
00:39:02,319 --> 00:39:04,980
No one here even knows about it

260
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:12,390
I can't help it, but I have a
feeling it may be my last

261
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,050
Really, Sir?

262
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:17,750
I don't think there's any coming back
from this one, kid

263
00:39:17,631 --> 00:39:18,500
Sir...

264
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,260
Don't cry

265
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,520
It's the terrorists

266
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,880
The Middle Eastern ones

267
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:27,920
You know... those guys...

268
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,300
mm-hmm

269
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,750
They've developed a plan to destroy the world

270
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:36,700
and I have to go and steal the magic
ingredients to the weapon

271
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,410
(Ah... weapons)

272
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,150
- Rachel?
- Yes, Sir?

273
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:46,240
X: I need you to help me save the world

274
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,630
Rachel: Huh... The whole world?

275
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:52,510
Can you do that? Can you be a hero?

276
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:54,961
Yes, Sir

277
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:58,829
Good

278
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,540
Here's what I need for you to do

279
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:07,970
Take this cellphone, guard it with your life

280
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:12,860
I'm going to be meeting my contacts

281
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:14,720
and they are very dangerous men and they

282
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:16,080
are going to want to know
that I am who I say I am

283
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,501
Do you understand?

284
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,761
Not really, Sir

285
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,751
Gonna take me into custody

286
00:40:24,751 --> 00:40:27,772
They're gonna dial that phone for a code

287
00:40:28,362 --> 00:40:31,610
If you don't give him that code,
or you don't answer that phone

288
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:33,971
I'll be killed

289
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:37,950
Now you understand?

290
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:40,860
Rachel: Huh... I think so, Sir

291
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:42,930
X: Protect that with your life

292
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:48,434
From now on, you shall be known
as agent...

293
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,680
..."D"

294
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,610
Rachel: "D"?

295
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,690
Any questions?

296
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,800
What's the code word?

297
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:01,770
Right

298
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,220
Huh...

299
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:06,500
Hmm... "Peppermint"

300
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,320
"Peppermint"?

301
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:10,900
X: "Peppermint"

302
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,981
Now go.

303
00:41:14,981 --> 00:41:17,221
I have to prepare for this kind of mission

304
00:41:17,221 --> 00:41:18,321
But Sir...

305
00:41:18,231 --> 00:41:21,721
[X: tears in voice] Please. Go.

306
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:28,950
Hmm?

307
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:30,310
Uh! George!

308
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:31,700
What... What are you doing?

309
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,150
Here you go, Sir

310
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:40,000
You know I like two sugars

311
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:46,480
You're dismissed

312
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,480
[George is laughing slowly]

313
00:41:57,650 --> 00:41:58,650
What's so funny?

314
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:01,189
You don't actually believe that
secret mission crap, do you?

315
00:42:01,881 --> 00:42:02,471
Rachel: hmm

316
00:42:02,572 --> 00:42:03,912
Oh my god, you do!

317
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,110
That's the oldest trick in the book

318
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:07,630
He just wants to fuck you

319
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
You're jealous

320
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,120
Jealous that I got a mission

321
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:13,900
You are a secretary

322
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,260
No one's gonna give you a mission

323
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:18,000
I am an administrative assistant

324
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
but I guess you know a thing or two

325
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,400
about not getting missions now, wouldn't you?

326
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,750
Well, except fetching coffee

327
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:28,810
Now why would you have to go there, okay?

328
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,750
I was just trying to warn he's trying to
get in your pants

329
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,450
Oh ***

330
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:33,310
What did you say?

331
00:42:33,845 --> 00:42:35,505
I said don't be such an ass

332
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,599
[sigh]

333
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,040
What is there with you in that fish tank anyway?

334
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:00,720
This is going to be the perfect underwater ecosystem

335
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:04,950
And I will be its God

336
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:09,670
You are not right

337
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:10,650
Yeah

338
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:14,180
Well at least I'm not waiting by
a phone that's never going to ring

339
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,060
It will ring

340
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:19,001
Why don't you have a little faith that
he'll accomplish the mission?

341
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,310
You just don't get it

342
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:24,140
He's not on a secret mission

343
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:26,859
Nobody knows anything about a secret mission

344
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:29,910
That's because it's secret, duh!

345
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:32,470
Honey, you know nothing of protocol

346
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:37,710
You really think he would tell a secretary
about a secret mission?

347
00:43:39,099 --> 00:43:41,839
I am an administrative assistant!

348
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,839
Let me see if I get this straight:

349
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:48,650
The story is there's a group of terrorists

350
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:50,490
and they've built a bomb

351
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:52,980
and they've threatened to
blow up the planet Earth

352
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,280
But alas this will be his last call of duty

353
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,880
And his fate rests squarely in palms of your hands

354
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,161
You're the only one he can trust

355
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,161
His last hope

356
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:08,300
Bla bla bla bla bla bla

357
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:10,740
Rachel: - Huh
George: - Yeah

358
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:14,059
Listen: that's a story he gave his last secretary

359
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,230
Rachel, listen, don't get mad

360
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:18,491
[tazzer sound]
George: Aargh!

361
00:44:20,371 --> 00:44:22,481
[Breathes]

362
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:27,749
That was totally unnecessary

363
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:31,910
You just tazzed because you're fighting for Agent X

364
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:34,591
and [indistinct speech]... ***

365
00:44:34,591 --> 00:44:37,501
...getting his dick sucked... *** [indistinct speech]

366
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,570
Do not make me tazz you twice in the same night

367
00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:42,450
Okay

368
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:43,450
[tazzer sound]

369
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:45,461
I am an administrative assistant!

370
00:44:45,461 --> 00:44:47,391
[tazzer sound]

371
00:44:46,871 --> 00:44:48,511
[George cries]

372
00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:04,611
She's crazy

373
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:10,550
Jesus, who are you, for God sake

374
00:46:10,050 --> 00:46:13,230
I think I just found ***

375
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:16,230
What do you think of this little swine?
