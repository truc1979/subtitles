00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:27,640
Congratulations on becoming agent Rachel

2
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:31,510
I knew you had it in you

3
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,270
Unfortunate about your husband

4
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:32,090
Yes

5
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:35,890
Well, I could not let my feelings for George
compromise the mission

6
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:57,900
Oh... Sorry

7
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,301
Sorry!

8
00:04:13,401 --> 00:04:14,641
Sorry...

9
00:05:10,641 --> 00:05:11,700
Nice tits

10
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:16,590
Does your husband appreciate this?

11
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:21,130
No... Husband doesn't appreciate anything

12
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:23,890
Bull(***?)

13
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:27,089
Dead fool(***?)

14
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:30,909
Ah, George never does that

15
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,000
George couldn't even make coffee

16
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:17,740
*** fucking secret-agent *** feels like

17
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,740
Yeah

18
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,750
- You can't teach that on training
- No

19
00:08:25,159 --> 00:08:27,269
I don't need that anymore

20
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:17,330
George never makes me come

21
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:19,010
George is a fool

22
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:00,475
No evidence

23
00:13:00,475 --> 00:13:02,940
Mission complete

24
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
- Ah!
(- Ah)

25
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,420
- Ah!
- Ah!

26
00:13:09,419 --> 00:13:11,200
Jesus Christ

27
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,260
George you scared the crap out of me

28
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,969
Yeah? You should see it from my point of view

29
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,760
Dreamed about that damn fish tank again?

30
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,910
Yeah. Things like that.

31
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,620
Thank you

32
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,160
Oh I have my cereal

33
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:18,190
Oh you think so?

34
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,109
Yeah. I do.

35
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,150
You feeling lucky?

36
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,650
Would you try to come take it?

37
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,731
Oh, I will

38
00:16:42,135 --> 00:16:46,170
You call yourself a secret agent,

39
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,450
no wonder they won't give you a promotion

40
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,600
Argh

41
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,001
Holly bitch

42
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:21,110
Hey, *** together

43
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:31,300
I take it as a "no"

44
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,640
Ladies first

45
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,210
Age before beauty

46
00:17:50,281 --> 00:17:52,411
Brains before stupidity

47
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,000
What I meant was you're the stupid one, ok?
(- Idiot)

48
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:05,470
(I'm the smart one.
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT)

49
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:07,290
I ***

50
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,100
Everybody knows that

51
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,440
No

52
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,980
Oh...

53
00:18:34,229 --> 00:18:35,539
Oh no

54
00:18:39,459 --> 00:18:41,978
Oh yeah, you want some of this

55
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,700
[composing phone number]

56
00:18:44,859 --> 00:18:47,439
[phone rings]
I *** you like a readheaded stepchild

57
00:18:50,409 --> 00:18:51,869
Oh no you didn't!

58
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,150
Can't believe you stick my spot

59
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:59,210
Oh, is this your spot?

60
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,210
You're dirty. You're dirty. Damn it.

61
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,320
(Hi Rachel)

62
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,990
Morning fellows

63
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:41,120
(Good morning)

64
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,070
I made brownies!

65
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:52,500
Who wnats some?

66
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,060
You don't have to do that I had

67
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,650
I had to park 4 blocks away

68
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:10,280
Well. Now you've had your cardio.

69
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,290
Those are the last of the brownies, isn't it?

70
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:16,730
I didn't even get one

71
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:21,030
Oh, honey... you have to watch your girlish figure

72
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:22,960
It's not fair Rachel

73
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,811
You know I wanted a brownie

74
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,140
George: life's not fair

75
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,490
That's one hell of a woman

76
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:33,290
One hell of a good cook yeah well you

77
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,470
Yeah, well,

78
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:36,070
you try being married to her for 6 years

79
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,190
(SEVEN!)

80
00:20:37,991 --> 00:20:41,691
I'm sorry the lack of sex is making my memory blurry

81
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:47,730
[beep]

82
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,230
Sorry you got to remove all metal from your pockets

83
00:20:58,181 --> 00:20:59,582
[beep]

84
00:20:59,582 --> 00:21:00,853
All metal

85
00:21:08,332 --> 00:21:09,032
[beep]

86
00:21:09,032 --> 00:21:10,522
So we're gonna do a more thorough

87
00:21:10,522 --> 00:21:11,032
Ah!

88
00:21:12,392 --> 00:21:15,482
Sam, it's time for a deep body cavity search

89
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,660
(So there I was...)

90
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:33,010
...surrounded by the enemy...

91
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:35,100
...deep in the jungles of Bolivia...

92
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:38,030
...unarmed and then suddenly I...

93
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,810
Agent Z?

94
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:42,640
Yes Sir

95
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,890
You're late

96
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:50,050
Yes Sir, there was a malfunction at security

97
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:51,850
*** Sir.

98
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:53,259
- Malfunction...?
- Yeah

99
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:56,300
I'll tell you what...

100
00:21:57,479 --> 00:21:59,699
I've got a big mission for you

101
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,600
What?

102
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:05,111
(Yes Sir)

103
00:22:05,879 --> 00:22:08,499
Go down to the break room

104
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,750
and give me a cup of coffee

105
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,740
[laughs]

106
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,900
You know how I like it

107
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:26,480
As I was saying, bullets buzzing over my head

108
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,700
I had no weapon

109
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:30,710
Suddenly, from the canopy above,
came the enemy: *zeeee*

110
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,001
- Hi!
- Argh!

111
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:53,780
Oh... Hi Amy

112
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:58,321
Ah, sorry, I didn't mean to startle you

113
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:01,970
No, it's okay, it's a middle of on edge(***?)

114
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,350
Too much caffeine

115
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,100
Well, I must compliment you on your cat-like reflexes

116
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,419
Oh...

117
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:14,169
Yeah, I was... uh...

118
00:23:14,169 --> 00:23:16,640
Comes with being a secret agent

119
00:23:17,769 --> 00:23:19,999
I'll have to be a little bit more careful around you

120
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:24,579
I didn't know you could be so... dangerous

121
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,390
Yeah, that's... that's me: dangerous

122
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:31,480
You know you could lose an eye

123
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:32,940
[laughs]

124
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,510
Hmm... Speaking of danger,
I have something to show you

125
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:39,510
Won't you come in?

126
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,340
How... cool!

127
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:23,429
(Wow)

128
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:29,081
[amazed laughs]

129
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,380
This is cool!

130
00:24:35,581 --> 00:24:37,051
What does this do?

131
00:24:37,051 --> 00:24:38,881
Oh, be careful with that,

132
00:24:38,881 --> 00:24:40,841
I'm having a lot of problems with it

133
00:24:40,841 --> 00:24:41,000
[George's smelling]

134
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,061
It contains nerve gas, but it keeps leaking

135
00:25:09,639 --> 00:25:12,061
A mini supercomputer

136
00:25:12,061 --> 00:25:15,111
Complete. With wireless internet

137
00:25:15,111 --> 00:25:17,631
Digital camera

138
00:25:17,631 --> 00:25:19,691
MP3 player

139
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:23,490
Cigarette lighter. Even an AM/FM radio

140
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,080
Can I have it?

141
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,631
No

142
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:34,110
What's this?

143
00:25:35,388 --> 00:25:37,110
Um...

144
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:39,740
That's...

145
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:43,960
That's... That's my vibrator

146
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,330
So you're planning on doing a little fly-fishing?

147
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:50,789
Oh that?

148
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,850
That is my pride and joy

149
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:54,280
It's impenetrable

150
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,660
Watch

151
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,879
[gunshot]

152
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:01,351
Wow!

153
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,280
You're crazy

154
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:12,190
Watch this

155
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:15,910
[sound of arrow]

156
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:22,299
Okay, I get it.

157
00:26:23,299 --> 00:26:24,750
This vest is specially designed

158
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,880
to increase the adrenaline and

159
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,440
testosterone of its wearer

160
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,870
giving him more strength, endurance

161
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:33,880
even enabling him to run faster

162
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,350
Well you think he could have made it
a little bit more fashionable

163
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:39,180
I mean it looks like a fishing vest

164
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,430
Do I look like I know anything about fashion?

165
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,890
Oh..! No no no, you know...

166
00:26:47,229 --> 00:26:49,599
No, the vest works. It's um...

167
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:54,020
You know it's just got lots of...
...convenient pockets

168
00:26:55,329 --> 00:26:57,260
It has an internal cooling system

169
00:26:57,260 --> 00:27:00,500
that regulates body temperature
and increases stamina

170
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,600
Imagine what that could do for you under fire

171
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:05,520
Just think what it could do for me in the bedroom

172
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,041
I already have

173
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:15,521
George: [um-um]

174
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:17,912
This is my latest invention:

175
00:27:17,912 --> 00:27:19,232
Training goggles

176
00:27:19,949 --> 00:27:23,519
It can create virtually any situation imaginable

177
00:27:24,269 --> 00:27:24,850
Really?

178
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:27,010
From flying to combat. Try.

179
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:31,440
(Okay)

180
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:37,870
Wow

181
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:46,130
That's cool. You do anything?

182
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:47,350
Anything

183
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:49,970
- Anything?
- Anything.

184
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,570
You want to ***?

185
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,950
You don't know how long it's been

186
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,870
Oh god you're naughty

187
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,000
Oh yes George take it

188
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,610
You know you've always wanted that type
of fucking ass of mine

189
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:24,330
Alright in that tight fucking ass?

190
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:12,490
Okay, that was a little weird

191
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:15,080
You don't know how long I've waited for that

192
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,160
You tricked me!?

193
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:20,000
You lured me down here to take advantage of me

194
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,379
you... you gadget siren

195
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:27,751
Oh... So...?

196
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,500
Oh come on you know I like you

197
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,810
I'm married! ***

198
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:35,950
It wasn't real

199
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,310
Felt real!

200
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,340
Don't! Don't touch me!

201
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,430
Predator

202
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,630
[Rachel's smelling]

203
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,940
Where have you been?

204
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:21,850
Huh? What?

205
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:24,280
You've been gone over an hour

206
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,250
X was looking for you

207
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:27,570
He was?

208
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:30,130
Yeah. He needed his coffee

209
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:32,000
Oh, yeah, right

210
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:35,950
So?

211
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,150
So what?

212
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:39,851
So where were you?

213
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,910
I was taking care of business in the lab

214
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:48,530
Business, huh?

215
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:53,550
And was this "business" wearing a white lab coat

216
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:57,090
and reeking a fake designer perfume?

217
00:36:56,951 --> 00:36:58,500
What are you talking about?

218
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,290
Don't play stupid with me, George

219
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:03,010
That little trollop: Amy 

220
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:04,060
What about her?

221
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:11,360
George I'm serious, I know that you know

222
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:12,000
that she knows that we're having marital issues

223
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:15,150
She's like a vulture waiting on the wings

224
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:18,390
You're a crazy Lady

225
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:20,370
Haha. I'm crazy?

226
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:21,780
I'M CRAZY?

227
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,001
I'm not the one was provoked by
a glass of milk this morning

228
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:28,370
I'm not the one that hassled
the security guards,

229
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,229
and we won't even discuss your bouts
of mourning road rage

230
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:32,580
WHAT??

231
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,250
I did not harass those security guards

232
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:37,500
you set me up, and for your information

233
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,770
they proceeded to get very intimate with me

234
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,580
I guess I should be grateful

235
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:44,280
because it's the closest thing I'm
head to sex in months

236
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,660
There you go again: always with the sex

237
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:51,010
We know what George?
Maybe if you learn a little technique

238
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:53,890
instead of humping me like a drunken Chihuahua

239
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:56,800
I would be a little more willing to participate

240
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,620
- Really?
- Yeah!

241
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:58,839
Really?

242
00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,930
Is there a problem here?

243
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:01,700
Together: NO SIR

244
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,980
Good

245
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:09,090
Rachel, I would like to see you alone, please

246
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,760
Absolutely

247
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:15,450
- Z?
- Yes?

248
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:17,890
- Where's my coffee?
- Coming up, Sir

249
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:22,561
"Where's my coffee?"

250
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,680
Rachel, have a seat

251
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:38,830
I am sitting, Sir

252
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:40,720
Right

253
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:49,160
Rachel, I need you

254
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:52,660
Excuse me?

255
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:55,280
Your help.

256
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,710
Oh

257
00:38:56,970 --> 00:38:59,780
You're the only one that I can trust I

258
00:39:00,809 --> 00:39:02,319
I have to go on a secret mission

259
00:39:02,319 --> 00:39:04,980
No one here even knows about it

260
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:12,390
I can't help it, but I have a
feeling it may be my last

261
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,050
Really, Sir?

262
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:17,750
I don't think there's any coming back
from this one, kid

263
00:39:17,631 --> 00:39:18,500
Sir...

264
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,260
Don't cry

265
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,520
It's the terrorists

266
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,880
The Middle Eastern ones

267
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:27,920
You know... those guys...

268
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,300
mm-hmm

269
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,750
They've developed a plan to destroy the world

270
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:36,700
and I have to go and steal the magic
ingredients to the weapon

271
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,410
(Ah... weapons)

272
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,150
- Rachel?
- Yes, Sir?

273
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:46,240
X: I need you to help me save the world

274
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,630
Rachel: Huh... The whole world?

275
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:52,510
Can you do that? Can you be a hero?

276
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:54,961
Yes, Sir

277
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:58,829
Good

278
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,540
Here's what I need for you to do

279
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:07,970
Take this cellphone, guard it with your life

280
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:12,860
I'm going to be meeting my contacts

281
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:14,720
and they are very dangerous men and they

282
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:16,080
are going to want to know
that I am who I say I am

283
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,501
Do you understand?

284
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,761
Not really, Sir

285
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,751
Gonna take me into custody

286
00:40:24,751 --> 00:40:27,772
They're gonna dial that phone for a code

287
00:40:28,362 --> 00:40:31,610
If you don't give him that code,
or you don't answer that phone

288
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:33,971
I'll be killed

289
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:37,950
Now you understand?

290
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:40,860
Rachel: Huh... I think so, Sir

291
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:42,930
X: Protect that with your life

292
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:48,434
From now on, you shall be known
as agent...

293
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,680
..."D"

294
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,610
Rachel: "D"?

295
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,690
Any questions?

296
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,800
What's the code word?

297
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:01,770
Right

298
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,220
Huh...

299
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:06,500
Hmm... "Peppermint"

300
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,320
"Peppermint"?

301
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:10,900
X: "Peppermint"

302
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,981
Now go.

303
00:41:14,981 --> 00:41:17,221
I have to prepare for this kind of mission

304
00:41:17,221 --> 00:41:18,321
But Sir...

305
00:41:18,231 --> 00:41:21,721
[X: tears in voice] Please. Go.

306
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:28,950
Hmm?

307
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:30,310
Uh! George!

308
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:31,700
What... What are you doing?

309
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,150
Here you go, Sir

310
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:40,000
You know I like two sugars

311
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:46,480
You're dismissed

312
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,480
[George is laughing slowly]

313
00:41:57,650 --> 00:41:58,650
What's so funny?

314
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:01,189
You don't actually believe that
secret mission crap, do you?

315
00:42:01,881 --> 00:42:02,471
Rachel: hmm

316
00:42:02,572 --> 00:42:03,912
Oh my god, you do!

317
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,110
That's the oldest trick in the book

318
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:07,630
He just wants to fuck you

319
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
You're jealous

320
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,120
Jealous that I got a mission

321
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:13,900
You are a secretary

322
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,260
No one's gonna give you a mission

323
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:18,000
I am an administrative assistant

324
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
but I guess you know a thing or two

325
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,400
about not getting missions now, wouldn't you?

326
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,750
Well, except fetching coffee

327
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:28,810
Now why would you have to go there, okay?

328
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,750
I was just trying to warn he's trying to
get in your pants

329
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,450
Oh ***

330
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:33,310
What did you say?

331
00:42:33,845 --> 00:42:35,505
I said don't be such an ass

332
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,599
[sigh]

333
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,040
What is there with you in that fish tank anyway?

334
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:00,720
This is going to be the perfect underwater ecosystem

335
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:04,950
And I will be its God

336
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:09,670
You are not right

337
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:10,650
Yeah

338
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:14,180
Well at least I'm not waiting by
a phone that's never going to ring

339
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,060
It will ring

340
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:19,001
Why don't you have a little faith that
he'll accomplish the mission?

341
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,310
You just don't get it

342
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:24,140
He's not on a secret mission

343
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:26,859
Nobody knows anything about a secret mission

344
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:29,910
That's because it's secret, duh!

345
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:32,470
Honey, you know nothing of protocol

346
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:37,710
You really think he would tell a secretary
about a secret mission?

347
00:43:39,099 --> 00:43:41,839
I am an administrative assistant!

348
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,839
Let me see if I get this straight:

349
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:48,650
The story is there's a group of terrorists

350
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:50,490
and they've built a bomb

351
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:52,980
and they've threatened to
blow up the planet Earth

352
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,280
But alas this will be his last call of duty

353
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,880
And his fate rests squarely in palms of your hands

354
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,161
You're the only one he can trust

355
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,161
His last hope

356
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:08,300
Bla bla bla bla bla bla

357
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:10,740
Rachel: - Huh
George: - Yeah

358
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:14,059
Listen: that's a story he gave his last secretary

359
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,230
Rachel, listen, don't get mad

360
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:18,491
[tazzer sound]
George: Aargh!

361
00:44:20,371 --> 00:44:22,481
[Breathes]

362
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:27,749
That was totally unnecessary

363
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:31,910
You just tazzed because you're fighting for Agent X

364
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:34,591
and [indistinct speech]... ***

365
00:44:34,591 --> 00:44:37,501
...getting his dick sucked... *** [indistinct speech]

366
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,570
Do not make me tazz you twice in the same night

367
00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:42,450
Okay

368
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:43,450
[tazzer sound]

369
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:45,461
I am an administrative assistant!

370
00:44:45,461 --> 00:44:47,391
[tazzer sound]

371
00:44:46,871 --> 00:44:48,511
[George cries]

372
00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:04,611
She's crazy

373
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:10,550
Jesus, who are you, for God sake

374
00:46:10,050 --> 00:46:13,230
I think I just found ***

375
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:16,230
What do you think of this little swine?

742
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:11,930
Efendi, I have located the agent south of the palace

743
01:26:12,050 --> 01:26:14,300
but these are different from the rest

744
01:26:15,300 --> 01:26:16,750
They want us to know they are here

745
01:26:17,690 --> 01:26:19,020
It's like they are taunting us

746
01:26:20,310 --> 01:26:22,320
and I think they have the American agent with them

747
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:25,380
Only he would be so bold

748
01:26:25,700 --> 01:26:28,220
I think his name is X

749
01:26:30,250 --> 01:26:31,520
Hold on a second

750
01:26:32,060 --> 01:26:33,910
[Hussein coughs]

751
01:26:36,580 --> 01:26:41,430
Agent X is here and you're sure?

752
01:26:42,250 --> 01:26:44,050
He took out some of our best men

753
01:26:43,950 --> 01:26:45,310
It's got to be him

754
01:26:45,890 --> 01:26:48,350
But we've captured a prisoner

755
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:50,450
(Find Abdul,)

756
01:26:50,500 --> 01:26:53,000
tell him to double the guard
watch and get out there

757
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,600
I want to know everything they're doing

758
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:56,360
They take a shit I want to know about it

759
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,779
Okay, they take a crap I don't
need to know about that

760
01:26:58,779 --> 01:27:00,820
But anything else I'm gonna know about it,
you understand?

761
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,380
And you interrogate the prisonner, okay?

762
01:27:03,380 --> 01:27:05,690
- Yes Effendi
- Go

763
01:27:19,950 --> 01:27:22,020
This room is very beautiful

764
01:27:22,921 --> 01:27:29,711
It must certainly is,
but not as beautiful as you

765
01:27:31,650 --> 01:27:36,840
Your beauty is as expansive as the desert

766
01:27:40,100 --> 01:27:43,590
You are like an oasis

767
01:27:47,500 --> 01:27:48,410
Oh...

768
01:27:50,500 --> 01:27:51,880
Look at me

769
01:28:03,900 --> 01:28:05,720
Do not fear my power

770
01:28:14,700 --> 01:28:15,780
What?

771
01:28:17,060 --> 01:28:18,850
Oh!

772
01:28:19,829 --> 01:28:21,640
My maid must have left this. Nevermind

773
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:26,620
Look into my eyes.
I want your passion

774
01:39:50,450 --> 01:39:52,030
You're so powerful

775
01:39:52,720 --> 01:39:55,430
- The treasures ***
- Abdul!

776
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:58,890
Abdul!

777
01:39:59,890 --> 01:40:01,530
I've broken all over the powers for you

778
01:40:01,530 --> 01:40:03,120
What are you doing in my room?

779
01:40:04,120 --> 01:40:05,700
(This is not your room?)

780
01:40:07,470 --> 01:40:09,420
And what is Teddy doing on the floor?

781
01:40:22,750 --> 01:40:25,100
Let... Let me explain...

782
01:40:25,100 --> 01:40:28,120
Explain what?

783
01:40:26,550 --> 01:40:29,570
That you have one of Hussein's
concubines in my bed?

784
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,240
If he finds out he'll cut off both our balls

785
01:40:32,621 --> 01:40:33,761
I will not tell

786
01:40:34,371 --> 01:40:36,111
You know what? Begone with yourself

787
01:40:36,150 --> 01:40:37,990
Be out of here before someone sees you

788
01:40:38,600 --> 01:40:43,000
Yes... A thousand pardons... [arabic]

789
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,470
I should kick your ass, but I have no time

790
01:40:45,470 --> 01:40:47,340
Hussein needs us. Dress quickly

791
01:41:08,350 --> 01:41:11,040
Huh, wait a minute

792
01:41:12,810 --> 01:41:14,490
Some of my cases are missing

793
01:41:16,830 --> 01:41:20,200
And where's Muffy?
Has anybody seen Muffy?

794
01:41:20,200 --> 01:41:21,800
What's a "muffy"?

795
01:41:22,500 --> 01:41:25,880
Muffy's my baby!
We have to go find Muffy

796
01:41:27,120 --> 01:41:30,320
She could be in the desert all by herself

797
01:41:29,100 --> 01:41:32,349
Rachel,

798
01:41:29,640 --> 01:41:32,130
get a hold of yourself.
We CANNOT go back

799
01:41:31,970 --> 01:41:35,860
Alright? There's no way she'd survive
the heat of the desert

800
01:41:36,520 --> 01:41:37,390
She's the casualty of war

801
01:41:37,900 --> 01:41:40,130
My baby...

802
01:41:43,300 --> 01:41:44,951
Hey look is this your shoe bag? these

803
01:41:54,200 --> 01:41:56,051
These are the new summer collection

804
01:41:58,600 --> 01:41:59,171
See.

805
01:41:59,172 --> 01:42:01,102
See how easily she forgot about Muffy

806
01:42:02,700 --> 01:42:04,090
You know that could be me out there

807
01:42:04,850 --> 01:42:08,610
And that you'd know the difference
of got married 6 years

808
01:42:08,610 --> 01:42:10,110
Seven!

809
01:42:10,110 --> 01:42:12,221
Seven years

810
01:42:13,500 --> 01:42:15,810
Seven looooong years

811
01:42:34,500 --> 01:42:35,130
Ooh

812
01:42:35,950 --> 01:42:38,700
Watson, this is not what I had in mind

813
01:42:39,700 --> 01:42:41,050
You've been on that dancing all night, sir

814
01:42:41,050 --> 01:42:42,250
surely it's my turn to ride

815
01:42:42,250 --> 01:42:44,870
Soon Watson, soon.
Remember those hostiles everywhere

816
01:42:44,950 --> 01:42:46,260
I must keep a lookout

817
01:42:47,500 --> 01:42:47,980
Oh

818
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,070
- What is it?
- I see something in the distance

819
01:42:51,400 --> 01:42:51,850
Where?

820
01:42:51,850 --> 01:42:53,600
Look alike southeast of our position

821
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:54,789
Pass me my lens

822
01:42:58,000 --> 01:42:59,859
What do you see?
What is it?

823
01:43:12,250 --> 01:43:14,510
I don't quite know Watson.
I can't make it out

824
01:43:15,300 --> 01:43:16,481
Good God

825
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:18,770
I think that he's gotten to me man

826
01:43:37,850 --> 01:43:39,670
[aaargh (George's making a big effort)]

827
01:43:40,100 --> 01:43:41,970
Stop ***, George

828
01:43:43,500 --> 01:43:44,830
It's really tight

829
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:46,650
Try sliding it in gently

830
01:43:46,700 --> 01:43:47,800
[George's forcing]

831
01:43:47,900 --> 01:43:48,990
Gently

832
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:51,031
Hold on

833
01:43:54,941 --> 01:43:55,971
Okay

834
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:04,450
[camel's yelling]

835
01:44:14,400 --> 01:44:15,930
[camel noises]

836
01:44:19,100 --> 01:44:20,310
Stop! Identify yourself

837
01:44:20,310 --> 01:44:22,550
Agent Jackson Watson, British intelligence

838
01:44:22,550 --> 01:44:24,290
Now where the hell were you today?

839
01:44:24,290 --> 01:44:26,010
You could have cost us the mission, man

840
01:44:26,010 --> 01:44:28,600
What? I made my pickup I don't understand

841
01:44:28,600 --> 01:44:29,250
What?

842
01:44:29,250 --> 01:44:30,251
The agents are...

843
01:44:30,251 --> 01:44:31,301
Yoohoo!

844
01:44:31,601 --> 01:44:34,601
Who the hell are you?

845
01:44:32,500 --> 01:44:34,080
(- You???)
(- What?)

846
01:44:34,080 --> 01:44:36,490
Wooo... I like your camel!

847
01:44:36,490 --> 01:44:38,090
Are you guys on a mission too?

848
01:44:38,810 --> 01:44:40,720
Identify yourself, what's your agency?

849
01:44:40,950 --> 01:44:44,081
Field agent Z, had a command a CIA

850
01:44:45,600 --> 01:44:47,530
You liar

851
01:44:48,110 --> 01:44:50,740
I'm sorry this is my husband Geroge

852
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:52,900
He watches the mission files in our building

853
01:44:52,900 --> 01:44:55,280
And I am the director's administrative
assistant, Rachel

854
01:44:55,500 --> 01:44:57,900
You guys must be the British
fellows who sent me the fax

855
01:44:57,950 --> 01:44:59,380
Pleased to meet you folks

856
01:44:59,380 --> 01:45:02,030
Good God what are you both doing here?

857
01:45:02,320 --> 01:45:04,670
This is a Code Red top-secret mission

858
01:45:05,050 --> 01:45:06,720
Not a sightseeing tour

859
01:45:07,700 --> 01:45:09,360
Okay, we'll take it from here

860
01:45:09,460 --> 01:45:12,380
You two, back in the camp while
we'll do recon of the area,

861
01:45:12,380 --> 01:45:14,280
and 0500 hours okay(?)

862
01:45:14,350 --> 01:45:16,590
Yes. Stay close to your tents

863
01:45:17,140 --> 01:45:19,500
Oh, don't get in our way

864
01:45:19,500 --> 01:45:22,220
- Hey, I think we can be of service
- Yeah

865
01:45:24,100 --> 01:45:25,490
Yes I think you might

866
01:45:25,900 --> 01:45:27,850
Very good, man. I'll ***
have a nice cup of tea

867
01:45:27,850 --> 01:45:29,670
and ***

868
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,720
Honey, your reputation precedes you

869
01:45:33,950 --> 01:45:34,960
Shut up Rachel

870
01:45:35,800 --> 01:45:38,910
So not really gonna stay in our tent
to let them have all the fun, are we?

871
01:45:40,200 --> 01:45:41,180
Yeah.

872
01:45:41,300 --> 01:45:46,150
Those limey bastards... Who they think they are?
Secret agents or something?

873
01:45:47,450 --> 01:45:50,190
Uuuuh... They are

874
01:45:50,941 --> 01:45:52,351
Oh... yeah... right

875
01:45:53,750 --> 01:45:56,710
Oh! I have an idea

876
01:45:57,010 --> 01:45:58,130
You know what we should do?

877
01:45:58,300 --> 01:46:00,660
We should get that nerve gas that you had

878
01:46:00,660 --> 01:46:04,450
and put it in their tent and then,
after they're asleep,

879
01:46:04,450 --> 01:46:07,280
We can go to the palace and steal
the map to the warehouse

880
01:46:07,500 --> 01:46:09,020
That's a great idea

881
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:12,870
Why do I have to go gas him in the tent?

882
01:46:14,050 --> 01:46:15,800
I thought you were the leader

883
01:46:15,800 --> 01:46:18,120
and if I was a leader that's what I would do

884
01:46:19,100 --> 01:46:20,140
Yes, of course

885
01:46:20,860 --> 01:46:21,770
I knew that

886
01:46:22,181 --> 01:46:24,430
I was just testing you, and you did well

887
01:46:25,400 --> 01:46:26,810
I want to go prepare the equipment

888
01:46:37,100 --> 01:46:38,670
Who do you work for?

889
01:46:40,850 --> 01:46:41,970
Tell me who sent you

890
01:46:44,950 --> 01:46:46,801
Where is the camp?

891
01:46:49,090 --> 01:46:51,350
Your silence only angers me

892
01:46:58,300 --> 01:46:58,921
Oh!

893
01:46:58,921 --> 01:47:00,451
Look at the will(?)

894
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:02,860
Dog. Little dog

895
01:47:03,200 --> 01:47:05,070
Hum. Leave the prisoner with me

896
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:07,589
Thank you

897
01:47:08,100 --> 01:47:09,519
- Pfff
- Dismissed

898
01:47:11,900 --> 01:47:13,950
We'll get the will(?) puppy wuppy

899
01:47:14,250 --> 01:47:17,100
You're so sweet I think I'll name you Jihad

900
01:47:17,500 --> 01:47:18,550
Wanna dance?

901
01:47:18,680 --> 01:47:22,490
So that's the way, uh-ha uh-ha, I like it

902
01:47:24,300 --> 01:47:27,540
[snorking]

903
01:47:36,600 --> 01:47:37,770
[*noise of camera taking a photo*]

904
01:47:52,450 --> 01:47:53,990
Which tent do you think they're in?

905
01:47:55,700 --> 01:47:57,180
I think it's that one

906
01:47:57,510 --> 01:47:58,101
That one?

907
01:47:58,101 --> 01:47:59,680
Yeah

908
01:47:58,912 --> 01:48:00,482
With the Union Jack?

909
01:48:01,172 --> 01:48:02,092
Yeah I think so

910
01:48:02,092 --> 01:48:03,622
That's a good guess

911
01:48:03,622 --> 01:48:04,342
- Yeah
- Yeah

912
01:49:04,100 --> 01:49:05,970
[*gas is leaking*]

913
01:49:29,940 --> 01:49:35,470
guys remember t

914
01:49:30,592 --> 01:49:32,272
Guys, remember:

915
01:49:32,272 --> 01:49:34,600
The only way inside the palace office,

916
01:49:34,600 --> 01:49:36,010
without setting off the alarm,

917
01:49:36,010 --> 01:49:37,440
is going to be through the roof

918
01:49:37,700 --> 01:49:38,970
Once you're inside,

919
01:49:38,970 --> 01:49:41,460
the map is going to be inside the desk

920
01:49:41,850 --> 01:49:42,520
- Got it?
- Okay

921
01:49:42,920 --> 01:49:43,670
Got it

922
01:49:56,450 --> 01:49:56,910
[body felt on the floor]

923
01:50:07,400 --> 01:50:08,410
Honey?

924
01:50:08,410 --> 01:50:10,290
How did you get in here?

925
01:50:10,820 --> 01:50:12,690
Front door. It's unlocked

926
01:50:25,150 --> 01:50:25,819
Okay

927
01:50:26,400 --> 01:50:28,251
- I'm gonna find the office
- Okay

928
01:50:44,600 --> 01:50:45,510
It's this way

929
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:46,540
Okay

930
01:50:47,500 --> 01:50:48,450
Rachel, wait

931
01:50:48,830 --> 01:50:50,250
Set off the alarm

932
01:51:23,600 --> 01:51:25,480
That was amazing

933
01:51:26,100 --> 01:51:28,330
Did you forget how flexible my body is?

934
01:51:29,340 --> 01:51:32,160
Well considering the fact that
you never let me see it anymore

935
01:51:32,160 --> 01:51:34,370
I've forgotten quite a few
things about your body

936
01:51:35,200 --> 01:51:37,440
Not now, George. Really

937
01:52:08,301 --> 01:52:09,551
It's locked

938
01:52:23,750 --> 01:52:24,530
- George?
- Uh?

939
01:52:24,950 --> 01:52:26,040
I found it

940
01:52:26,300 --> 01:52:27,670
- So get out of there
- Okay

941
01:52:27,850 --> 01:52:28,750
[*crash*]

942
01:52:29,110 --> 01:52:31,960
[*alarm*]

943
01:52:32,500 --> 01:52:33,530
Come on Rachel

944
01:52:34,450 --> 01:52:36,650
- Go, go
- There's a problem George

945
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:55,800
[*gunshots*]

946
01:53:35,550 --> 01:53:37,010
Oh...

947
01:53:39,400 --> 01:53:41,390
Watson, the full of my head's been bashed in

948
01:53:43,790 --> 01:53:45,050
I think it was this, sir

949
01:53:47,300 --> 01:53:48,820
Those damned Americans

950
01:53:49,350 --> 01:53:50,740
They're gonna get us killed, Watson

951
01:53:52,250 --> 01:53:53,830
They think they're Cowboys or something

952
01:53:54,830 --> 01:53:56,361
Too much television I'd say

953
01:54:10,900 --> 01:54:12,480
What the hell was you thinking?

954
01:54:12,650 --> 01:54:14,110
You're gonna get us all killed

955
01:54:14,250 --> 01:54:15,500
This isn't a game

956
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:17,490
You do anything like that again,

957
01:54:17,490 --> 01:54:18,050
and I will...

958
01:54:18,050 --> 01:54:19,080
You'll what?

959
01:54:20,200 --> 01:54:22,650
I'll be forced to kill you

960
01:54:23,310 --> 01:54:25,449
[Rachel's laughing]
I would like to see you try

961
01:54:26,650 --> 01:54:27,590
[tazzer]

962
01:54:29,470 --> 01:54:30,681
Ha ha ha

963
01:54:31,200 --> 01:54:32,610
That's smart, doesn't it?

964
01:54:32,610 --> 01:54:34,770
Oh you gotta watch her with that,
she's like a ninja

965
01:54:38,320 --> 01:54:39,859
Anything you'd like to add?

966
01:54:49,450 --> 01:54:50,740
We got the map

967
01:54:51,800 --> 01:54:54,490
Here what? Well done!

968
01:54:54,850 --> 01:54:56,290
So we're team now, right?

969
01:54:56,860 --> 01:55:00,860
♪ You want our help ♪
♪ You want our help ♪

970
01:55:00,800 --> 01:55:02,850
Good! Say it!
Say it!

971
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,710
Yes, yes, we need your help

972
01:55:08,110 --> 01:55:12,510
Oh, and I also got you this

973
01:55:13,200 --> 01:55:15,691
On here you'll find all the
reconnaissance photos

974
01:55:15,691 --> 01:55:17,681
to get you safely into the palace

975
01:55:18,541 --> 01:55:20,551
Excellent work my dear

976
01:55:23,061 --> 01:55:25,181
What the hell happened to you, man?

977
01:55:25,851 --> 01:55:29,191
Oh well I had to take out a couple
of guards too

978
01:55:29,750 --> 01:55:33,200
In fact I killed them with my bare hands

979
01:55:33,400 --> 01:55:36,511
I got rid of the bodies,
I dragged them far away

980
01:55:36,560 --> 01:55:39,970
They'll never be found so, you know,
you don't have to worry

981
01:55:39,970 --> 01:55:41,180
Won't come back on you

982
01:55:42,450 --> 01:55:45,070
Yes. Quite the hero he was

983
01:55:46,070 --> 01:55:49,070
Oh. Good job, man.
I was wrong about you

984
01:55:49,350 --> 01:55:51,250
I thought you were just a pen pusher

985
01:55:52,650 --> 01:55:54,890
Well... We got lots of training to do

986
01:55:54,890 --> 01:55:57,621
We have to go over the intel reports
there Rachel gather

987
01:56:04,241 --> 01:56:06,021
Argh... Watson?

988
01:56:06,300 --> 01:56:07,020
Yes?

989
01:56:07,020 --> 01:56:08,900
That's one ***, Watson

990
01:56:09,650 --> 01:56:11,020
I should say

991
01:56:11,400 --> 01:56:12,200
[*noise of camera taking a photo*]

992
01:56:14,250 --> 01:56:15,190
Nice

993
01:56:18,400 --> 01:56:19,701
You're okay, sir?

994
01:56:20,100 --> 01:56:22,180
No. I'm not okay

995
01:56:22,980 --> 01:56:24,180
Get a cup of tea?

996
01:56:24,500 --> 01:56:25,300
Two sugars

997
01:56:25,300 --> 01:56:26,620
Yeah, ok, I go get some, sir

998
01:56:34,500 --> 01:56:35,910
Let's go! Ready for the ***

999
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:37,290
Let's go, move it, push it up,

1000
01:56:37,300 --> 01:56:38,600
yeah, that's right Jackson

1001
01:56:38,600 --> 01:56:40,300
Move it, up and down, up and down

1002
01:56:40,730 --> 01:56:42,020
Watson, good job!

1003
01:56:54,600 --> 01:56:55,980
Go, go, go

1004
01:57:11,900 --> 01:57:12,810
I'm okay!

1005
01:57:24,950 --> 01:57:25,990
I'm okay!

1006
01:57:51,300 --> 01:57:53,060
[*crash*]

1007
01:57:55,450 --> 01:57:57,020
Okay, now listen up

1008
01:57:57,500 --> 01:57:59,490
Me and Watson will take out
the palace guards here

1009
01:57:59,700 --> 01:58:00,600
and here

1010
01:58:00,950 --> 01:58:03,410
Moving forward to the throne room
and take out Husein

1011
01:58:04,100 --> 01:58:05,591
Rachel, George,

1012
01:58:05,591 --> 01:58:06,901
take Bob's Jeep,

1013
01:58:06,901 --> 01:58:08,731
go to the warehouse

1014
01:58:10,200 --> 01:58:13,250
Go to the warehouse and disarm the weapon,

1015
01:58:13,350 --> 01:58:15,180
by removing the uranium warhead

1016
01:58:15,600 --> 01:58:16,820
Now don't mess this up

1017
01:58:16,820 --> 01:58:18,000
Is everyone clear?

1018
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:18,690
Yes, sir

1019
01:58:18,690 --> 01:58:19,610
Good

1020
01:58:22,400 --> 01:58:23,510
Watson, what are you doing?

1021
01:58:24,050 --> 01:58:25,470
Something to remember our trip together

1022
01:58:25,470 --> 01:58:26,400
Good God, man.

1023
01:58:26,400 --> 01:58:28,650
This is not a bloody lads holidays,
this is a mission

1024
01:58:28,650 --> 01:58:29,461
Now move out

1025
01:58:32,491 --> 01:58:35,431
Not that cheap, it's almost paid off(?)

1026
01:59:11,700 --> 01:59:13,730
- ***
- ***

1027
01:59:17,250 --> 01:59:18,220
Listen Watson,

1028
01:59:18,340 --> 01:59:20,900
we have *** on this idea

1029
01:59:20,900 --> 01:59:22,410
we can't going guns blazing(?)

1030
01:59:22,800 --> 01:59:24,579
So you have your silencer?

1031
01:59:24,579 --> 01:59:25,109
And knife

1032
01:59:25,600 --> 01:59:28,241
Then you go on fire, and kill anyone
you come across

1033
01:59:28,750 --> 01:59:29,300
Anyone?

1034
01:59:29,300 --> 01:59:32,040
Yes. Anyone, man,
if you want to get out alife(?)

1035
01:59:32,650 --> 01:59:34,490
- Is it clear?
- Crystal

1036
01:59:34,490 --> 01:59:35,209
Follow me

1037
01:59:43,800 --> 01:59:46,300
[*Indistinct girls voices in the background*]

1038
01:59:48,800 --> 01:59:50,030
- You hear that?

1039
02:00:11,900 --> 02:00:12,840
Oh my God...

1040
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:15,180
I've died and gone to heaven

1041
02:00:15,300 --> 02:00:17,340
Don't worry, I'll take out this

1042
02:00:17,340 --> 02:00:18,470
What are you doing, man?

1043
02:00:18,900 --> 02:00:20,500
You forgot your training?

1044
02:00:20,500 --> 02:00:21,700
Hostiles, sir

1045
02:00:22,150 --> 02:00:23,560
Kill anyone I see

1046
02:00:23,560 --> 02:00:25,281
It's them or me, that's what you said

1047
02:00:25,400 --> 02:00:27,870
Goodness me, have you forgot what
is to be a British agent?

1048
02:00:28,600 --> 02:00:30,230
To protect our fine country, sir

1049
02:00:30,400 --> 02:00:32,511
Oh my God, no no no,
to be licensed to kill,

1050
02:00:32,511 --> 02:00:35,900
and licensed to fuck the finest
women the world has to offer

1051
02:00:36,050 --> 02:00:38,150
Ah... So this is not the time to kill

1052
02:00:38,150 --> 02:00:38,750
No

1053
02:00:38,900 --> 02:00:39,940
No no no,

1054
02:00:39,940 --> 02:00:42,770
this is time to "party"

1055
02:00:50,671 --> 02:00:52,791
- Yes
- No no no, don't, no

1056
02:00:53,550 --> 02:00:56,000
What are you doing in these chambers,
it is forbidden

1057
02:00:58,550 --> 02:01:00,290
- You can scream and I'll just know it
- Oh...

1058
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:02,060
Don't worry

1059
02:01:02,230 --> 02:01:05,090
We would not alert the guards to
the presence of our rescuers

1060
02:01:06,550 --> 02:01:07,460
Rescuers?

1061
02:01:07,540 --> 02:01:09,419
You are here to rescue us, aren't you?

1062
02:01:09,419 --> 02:01:10,449
Of course we are! Yes,

1063
02:01:10,449 --> 02:01:13,150
Yes, we're here to rescue.
We're just glad you're all in one piece

1064
02:01:13,479 --> 02:01:16,159
We have not seen men like you before

1065
02:01:16,159 --> 02:01:18,000
We only see one man

1066
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,329
Oh... That's nice... I guess

1067
02:01:20,320 --> 02:01:22,920
Nice? Have you seen him?

1068
02:01:27,600 --> 02:01:28,949
Holy Jesus!

1069
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:30,600
Uh... Nasty

1070
02:01:30,600 --> 02:01:31,660
You see?

1071
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:33,250
Well, yes, I do

1072
02:01:35,050 --> 02:01:37,400
Well, we must be awful.
We're gonna clear the palace

1073
02:01:37,450 --> 02:01:38,739
to rescue you of course

1074
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:39,700
Wait!

1075
02:01:39,900 --> 02:01:42,630
You must do one thing for us before you leave

1076
02:01:43,850 --> 02:01:46,859
You must pleasure us before
you leave this place

1077
02:01:47,500 --> 02:01:49,260
What? All of you?

1078
02:01:50,260 --> 02:01:52,360
My God. I did die and go to heaven

1079
02:12:39,700 --> 02:12:41,120
God damn it

1080
02:12:41,750 --> 02:12:43,080
Hostiles on the road

1081
02:12:44,800 --> 02:12:46,070
***

1082
02:12:48,050 --> 02:12:49,431
You know, I have an idea

1083
02:12:53,700 --> 02:12:55,010
I want to use the big gun

1084
02:12:55,120 --> 02:12:57,730
Rachel, this is not a big gun,
this is a rocket launcher

1085
02:12:57,850 --> 02:12:59,650
Whatever it is, I want to use it

1086
02:12:59,650 --> 02:13:00,600
- It's my turn
- No, no

1087
02:13:00,600 --> 02:13:02,190
- Yes
- Rachel, no

1088
02:13:02,190 --> 02:13:02,880
Yes

1089
02:13:03,201 --> 02:13:03,921
No

1090
02:13:07,001 --> 02:13:09,931
If you don't let me use it, you never
gonna see my naked body again

1091
02:13:10,700 --> 02:13:12,990
Oh, and that's any different from now how?

1092
02:13:13,500 --> 02:13:14,981
Aw, just thinking you know,

1093
02:13:14,981 --> 02:13:17,001
it's really hot out here

1094
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:21,510
***, how cute you look in those

1095
02:13:21,510 --> 02:13:23,600
desert camel outfit

1096
02:13:24,500 --> 02:13:25,520
- Good
- Yeah

1097
02:13:26,050 --> 02:13:27,150
You know,

1098
02:13:27,150 --> 02:13:29,230
how much I wanna touch your big,

1099
02:13:29,230 --> 02:13:31,250
hard, rocket?

1100
02:13:31,250 --> 02:13:31,600
[*sigh*]

1101
02:13:31,600 --> 02:13:32,400
[*bang*]

1102
02:13:36,800 --> 02:13:39,560
See George, that's the problem with you:

1103
02:13:39,650 --> 02:13:41,400
Alyways premature

1104
02:13:41,400 --> 02:13:43,779
Rachel, shut up, come on.
Get out of here

1105
02:14:01,350 --> 02:14:03,850
30,000 FEET ABOVE THE EARTH,
EVIL SWOOPS IN

1106
02:14:15,100 --> 02:14:16,700
On the way

1107
02:14:33,489 --> 02:14:35,089
*** required

1108
02:15:23,200 --> 02:15:24,820
Go, go, go

1109
02:15:33,850 --> 02:15:35,610
I think you should try to make it to the door

1110
02:15:36,400 --> 02:15:37,850
Maybe it's unlocked

1111
02:15:39,500 --> 02:15:40,760
Come on hop with me

1112
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:41,910
Ready?

1113
02:15:45,400 --> 02:15:46,350
What are you doing?

1114
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:49,280
I think we should go by the window

1115
02:15:49,280 --> 02:15:50,780
and yell for help, okay?

1116
02:15:50,900 --> 02:15:53,270
George, that's a stupid idea

1117
02:15:53,590 --> 02:15:54,440
Come on this way

1118
02:15:54,440 --> 02:15:55,021
No

1119
02:15:55,400 --> 02:15:56,570
- This way
- No, this way

1120
02:15:56,570 --> 02:15:58,560
- This way
- This way

1121
02:16:00,241 --> 02:16:01,081
[Together:] - THIS WAY

1122
02:16:01,071 --> 02:16:01,521
No!

1123
02:16:02,050 --> 02:16:02,760
Ah!

1124
02:16:05,641 --> 02:16:07,000
Oh, fuck

1125
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:07,550
(Ouch)

1126
02:16:09,450 --> 02:16:11,090
Idiot...

1127
02:16:14,950 --> 02:16:16,761
I can't believe you *** the Jeep

1128
02:16:17,700 --> 02:16:18,420
Me?

1129
02:16:18,800 --> 02:16:19,600
ME!?

1130
02:16:20,100 --> 02:16:23,020
I can't fucking believe I brought
you on this mission

1131
02:16:24,150 --> 02:16:25,870
After six years of marriage,

1132
02:16:25,870 --> 02:16:27,800
you think I've learned my lesson,

1133
02:16:27,800 --> 02:16:28,920
but no.

1134
02:16:29,100 --> 02:16:32,419
My dumb ass brings your dumb ass
halfway around the world

1135
02:16:32,419 --> 02:16:34,929
so you can make me look
like a bigger dumbass

1136
02:16:35,260 --> 02:16:36,480
Unbelievable!

1137
02:16:36,800 --> 02:16:37,679
Wow,

1138
02:16:37,679 --> 02:16:39,220
Little pent-up, aren't you?

1139
02:16:39,220 --> 02:16:40,330
- Yes, think(?)
- *ouch*

1140
02:16:40,740 --> 02:16:42,600
Can a man just get a little head,

1141
02:16:42,600 --> 02:16:43,730
just a little, 

1142
02:16:43,730 --> 02:16:47,070
just a little sucky sucky,
a blow job here and there?

1143
02:16:49,500 --> 02:16:50,890
Have you lost your mind?

1144
02:16:50,890 --> 02:16:52,480
Are you crazy?

1145
02:16:53,500 --> 02:16:55,440
We're in this mess because
you broke the Jeep

1146
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:56,980
[George coughs]

1147
02:16:57,750 --> 02:17:00,130
This- was- your- fault

1148
02:17:01,200 --> 02:17:02,340
My fault?

1149
02:17:02,340 --> 02:17:04,400
How the fuck is this my fault?

1150
02:17:04,890 --> 02:17:09,050
"Oh you're so sexy in the uniform".
Blah blah blah

1151
02:17:09,230 --> 02:17:11,340
If you weren't busy molesting a rocket launcher,

1152
02:17:11,340 --> 02:17:13,600
I wouldn't have accidentally set it off

1153
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:15,640
Are you kidding me?

1154
02:17:19,700 --> 02:17:20,940
Rachel,

1155
02:17:20,940 --> 02:17:27,230
give any idea how hard it is to be
married to a beautiful woman like you,

1156
02:17:28,230 --> 02:17:30,910
and having guys constantly
vying for your attention,

1157
02:17:30,910 --> 02:17:32,530
trying to impress you?

1158
02:17:37,100 --> 02:17:40,010
I know you want to be with
a successful man,

1159
02:17:40,010 --> 02:17:42,970
like... like Agent X,

1160
02:17:45,200 --> 02:17:47,011
and on top of that,

1161
02:17:48,011 --> 02:17:50,171
you know every day I still want you,

1162
02:17:50,171 --> 02:17:52,841
just as bad and just as passionately,

1163
02:17:53,850 --> 02:17:56,240
as the first day I laid eyes on you

1164
02:17:57,300 --> 02:17:58,620
And you don't seem...

1165
02:18:01,100 --> 02:18:03,310
...to want me... To...

1166
02:18:04,400 --> 02:18:06,209
To want me at all

1167
02:18:08,350 --> 02:18:10,399
That's not true, George

1168
02:18:13,700 --> 02:18:14,820
You're just...

1169
02:18:16,450 --> 02:18:18,500
You're obsessed with your job and...

1170
02:18:19,200 --> 02:18:20,340
[*sigh*]

1171
02:18:21,340 --> 02:18:23,100
getting a mission...

1172
02:18:26,500 --> 02:18:27,670
...it's...

1173
02:18:28,700 --> 02:18:31,440
...it's like I'm not
important to you anymore

1174
02:18:32,650 --> 02:18:34,210
Don't you get it?

1175
02:18:35,700 --> 02:18:37,720
It's because you're important to me

1176
02:18:39,400 --> 02:18:40,440
that I want a mission,

1177
02:18:40,440 --> 02:18:43,900
that I want to keep my head buried in the work

1178
02:18:44,850 --> 02:18:46,540
I want you to be proud of me,
I want you to...

1179
02:18:46,800 --> 02:18:48,160
I want you to be proud

1180
02:18:48,700 --> 02:18:49,870
walking around with me

1181
02:18:50,950 --> 02:18:51,930
Baby,

1182
02:18:53,100 --> 02:18:54,611
I am proud of you

1183
02:18:54,611 --> 02:18:55,951
You mean it?

1184
02:18:56,681 --> 02:18:58,051
Yes, of course

1185
02:18:59,350 --> 02:19:00,270
I love you

1186
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:04,340
I love you too

1187
02:19:13,450 --> 02:19:15,020
How very touching

1188
02:19:16,150 --> 02:19:17,680
Agent M?

1189
02:19:17,800 --> 02:19:19,300
Don't look so shocked

1190
02:19:19,800 --> 02:19:21,480
And it's Miranda

1191
02:19:21,850 --> 02:19:23,130
(- But why?)

1192
02:19:23,440 --> 02:19:24,950
Uh, money. Why else?

1193
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:26,890
Come.

1194
02:19:26,890 --> 02:19:29,040
I've brought the coordinates
to the White House,

1195
02:19:29,040 --> 02:19:31,451
I'll deal with these lovebirds later

1196
02:19:36,400 --> 02:19:38,060
Always thought she was kind of a bitch

1197
02:19:38,060 --> 02:19:38,920
Yeah

1198
02:19:39,250 --> 02:19:41,800
She big monstrous feet too

1199
02:19:42,350 --> 02:19:44,679
I hope the Brits are better luck than us

1200
02:19:53,150 --> 02:19:54,840
Hum hum. Sir?

1201
02:19:54,840 --> 02:19:56,170
What is it Watson?

1202
02:19:57,550 --> 02:20:00,730
We're gonna need a damn good
plan to get past his own guards

1203
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:04,000
Yes Watson. I'm on it

1204
02:20:05,300 --> 02:20:07,160
I have an idea

1205
02:20:21,400 --> 02:20:22,450
Are you fidgeting?

1206
02:20:22,640 --> 02:20:23,450
Trust me

1207
02:20:25,900 --> 02:20:27,500
I know that sound

1208
02:20:28,900 --> 02:20:29,710
What is that?

1209
02:20:29,810 --> 02:20:31,130
It's my nail file

1210
02:20:32,100 --> 02:20:33,170
Oh...

1211
02:20:36,100 --> 02:20:37,030
***

1212
02:20:47,950 --> 02:20:49,000
- Are you okay?
- Yeah

1213
02:20:50,350 --> 02:20:51,660
Did you mean what you said?

1214
02:20:51,800 --> 02:20:53,010
Of course I did

1215
02:21:02,200 --> 02:21:04,000
Still gonna stop them now 

1216
02:21:04,850 --> 02:21:05,610
I know

1217
02:21:07,100 --> 02:21:09,190
All right, I'm going to strike the bomb,

1218
02:21:10,100 --> 02:21:11,301
you create a diversion

1219
02:21:11,301 --> 02:21:11,801
Okay

1220
02:21:11,801 --> 02:21:12,451
Okay?

1221
02:21:14,150 --> 02:21:14,900
Rachel?

1222
02:21:16,300 --> 02:21:17,390
Did I thank you?

1223
02:21:18,150 --> 02:21:19,110
No

1224
02:21:19,759 --> 02:21:20,980
I will

1225
02:21:34,700 --> 02:21:36,420
I could go this way, strike the bomb,

1226
02:21:36,420 --> 02:21:37,980
you go that way

1227
02:21:39,950 --> 02:21:40,850
Okay?

1228
02:22:11,050 --> 02:22:12,330
Oh shit

1229
02:22:15,900 --> 02:22:16,630
Hi

1230
02:22:18,600 --> 02:22:19,870
Just...

1231
02:22:19,870 --> 02:22:21,261
...looking for the...

1232
02:22:21,750 --> 02:22:22,550
...ladies room

1233
02:22:29,200 --> 02:22:30,920
I tell you Gamush:

1234
02:22:31,650 --> 02:22:34,479
donkey fucking will become a sport

1235
02:22:34,600 --> 02:22:37,140
Babali, it will never become a sport

1236
02:22:37,140 --> 02:22:38,770
Who, in the right mind,

1237
02:22:38,770 --> 02:22:41,000
would pay good money to see such a thing,

1238
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:43,950
when you know that horses are
so much more entertaining?

1239
02:22:43,950 --> 02:22:45,331
Horses aren't entertaining

1240
02:22:47,400 --> 02:22:48,999
[*door opens*]

1241
02:22:48,999 --> 02:22:50,269
[*chains and arabic jewelry sounds*]

1242
02:22:53,900 --> 02:22:55,070
This never gonna work

1243
02:22:55,329 --> 02:22:56,339
Some faith, man

1244
02:22:56,339 --> 02:22:57,089
Some faith?

1245
02:22:57,250 --> 02:22:59,200
I am a *** agent around lady's underpants

1246
02:22:59,200 --> 02:22:59,700
Shhh!

1247
02:23:00,200 --> 02:23:01,050
What do we have here?

1248
02:23:01,050 --> 02:23:03,720
I have two new concubines for His Highness

1249
02:23:04,800 --> 02:23:07,710
Ah... Very very nice

1250
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:11,590
I'm thinking I like this one

1251
02:23:11,590 --> 02:23:12,060
Uh

1252
02:23:12,060 --> 02:23:13,390
Strong like horse

1253
02:23:13,390 --> 02:23:15,410
How dare you touch Hussein's property?

1254
02:23:15,410 --> 02:23:18,340
He would cut your hand off
for showing such disrespect

1255
02:23:18,650 --> 02:23:21,460
Now step aside and let us ***

1256
02:23:22,200 --> 02:23:24,080
Thousand fathers, ***

1257
02:23:24,080 --> 02:23:25,160
What were you thinking?

1258
02:23:26,160 --> 02:23:26,770
What we're...

1259
02:23:27,850 --> 02:23:29,850
Ho ho, that was for me?

1260
02:23:29,850 --> 02:23:31,450
For you? What are you talking about?

1261
02:23:31,450 --> 02:23:33,392
You look like every other guard here

1262
02:23:33,540 --> 02:23:34,750
I'm a very handsome man

1263
02:23:34,750 --> 02:23:36,040
I have a nice physique

1264
02:23:36,740 --> 02:23:38,550
Hmm, maybe you are right. Okay.

1265
02:23:38,550 --> 02:23:39,300
(I ***)

1266
02:23:39,300 --> 02:23:41,309
- Let's go back to our post
- Okay

1267
02:23:42,150 --> 02:23:43,880
Who's my little Jihad?

1268
02:23:43,880 --> 02:23:45,470
Who is my little Jihad?

1269
02:23:45,470 --> 02:23:46,070
Come on

1270
02:23:46,220 --> 02:23:47,320
A kiss to Papa

1271
02:23:47,320 --> 02:23:48,430
Come on, don't be shy

1272
02:23:48,410 --> 02:23:49,130
There you go

1273
02:23:49,130 --> 02:23:50,850
Oh, would you talk cutie thing(?)

1274
02:23:51,100 --> 02:23:52,660
Hello, what's this?

1275
02:23:52,750 --> 02:23:55,340
I have brought two new wives for you

1276
02:23:56,131 --> 02:23:58,151
Ah... Two wives for me

1277
02:23:58,350 --> 02:23:59,790
Jade you shouldn't have

1278
02:23:59,790 --> 02:24:02,099
Is this in honor of my birthday next week?

1279
02:24:04,650 --> 02:24:05,560
[*gunshots*]

1280
02:24:21,850 --> 02:24:22,600
Go

1281
02:24:23,900 --> 02:24:24,940
Wait for me

1282
02:25:05,541 --> 02:25:06,890
What's took you so long?

1283
02:25:08,220 --> 02:25:09,930
Gather the girls made me out fun(?)

1284
02:25:11,150 --> 02:25:11,700
Okay

1285
02:25:13,700 --> 02:25:14,640
*** Watson

1286
02:25:19,700 --> 02:25:21,040
Well we go. Come

1287
02:25:40,400 --> 02:25:41,430
Let's see...

1288
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:55,261
Ah... It is nice

1289
02:26:24,150 --> 02:26:24,930
[*Jafar laughs*]

1290
02:26:25,600 --> 02:26:27,670
