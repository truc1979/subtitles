00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:21,630
missing us by inches

42
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:23,130
do you have any idea how difficult is to

43
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:26,069
operate a successful mission world

44
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:30,120
resting lady garments what we was

45
00:05:26,069 --> 00:05:32,580
wearing is inconsequential Watson I'd

46
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,080
have to disagree sir it's quite

47
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:39,449
difficult to outrun the hostiles at a

48
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:41,159
skirt enough Watson so there we were

49
00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:46,620

00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:48,750
guard heavily outnumbered the bear in

51
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:50,819

52
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:52,139
alive but still we battled on we fought

53
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:53,940
away for the flames and the falling

54
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:56,610
debris until we caught up with the evil

55
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:59,250

shit down here mm-hmm well you see we've

123
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:13,980
managed to isolate a pheromone that's

124
00:23:10,379 --> 00:23:17,039
only detectable to females and although

125
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:20,039
odorless and colorless it induces

126
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:22,679
extreme sexual arousal and pleasurable

127
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:25,049
endorphins when inhaled thus clouding

128
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:27,299
the judgment of any female and when

129
00:23:25,049 --> 00:23:29,879
mixed with any standard men's cologne it

130
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:32,429
becomes an invaluable tool to our male

131
00:23:29,879 --> 00:23:37,950
agents to stracke and obtain information

132
00:23:32,429 --> 00:23:44,490

my face that was so sensitive man let's

425
01:37:46,070 --> 01:37:49,210
just brief Rachel now would you

426
01:37:51,890 --> 01:37:55,770
well as you know this island is the

427
01:37:54,270 --> 01:37:57,260
smallest of the group belonging to North

428
01:37:55,770 --> 01:37:59,730
Korean leader Jong Il

429
01:37:57,260 --> 01:38:01,410
now a British intel has informed us that

430
01:37:59,730 --> 01:38:05,130
he has hidden some sort of weapon here

431
01:38:01,410 --> 01:38:08,520
in preparing for attack we've been using

432
01:38:05,130 --> 01:38:10,760
select imagery to scan the terrain for

433
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:16,950
any photographic element of anything

434
01:38:10,760 --> 01:38:19,670
man-made existing out here so we began

435
01:38:16,950 --> 01:38:22,740
searching the island on for two days ago

436
01:38:19,670 --> 01:38:26,430
thinking perhaps jong-il had stashed the

437
01:38:22,740 --> 01:38:30,450
weapons in a cave that's so far we've

438
01:38:26,430 --> 01:38:31,680
had no luck hmm have you guys consider

439
01:38:30,450 --> 01:38:47,160
the possibility that maybe it's

440
01:38:31,680 --> 01:38:49,470
underground no yes okay here I'll hack

441
01:38:47,160 --> 01:38:52,080
into one of the USS heat-seeking

442
01:38:49,470 --> 01:38:55,730
satellites reposition it to scan this

443
01:38:52,080 --> 01:38:55,730
