00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:54,050

166
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:57,910
into some seriously kinky shit down here

167
00:22:56,660 --> 00:23:00,710
mm-hmm

168
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:02,450
well you see we've managed to isolate a

169
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:05,990
pheromone that's only detectable to

170
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:09,410
females and although odorless and

171
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:11,960
colorless it induces extreme sexual

172
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:14,360
arousal and pleasurable endorphins when

173
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:16,820
inhaled thus clouding the judgment of

174
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:19,100
any female and when mixed with any

175
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:22,370
standard men's cologne it becomes an

176
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:24,080
invaluable tool to our male agents to

177
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:28,940
distract and obtain information from

178
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:35,480
would be females acids mm-hmm God all
