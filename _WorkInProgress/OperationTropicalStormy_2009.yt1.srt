121
00:22:56,670 --> 00:23:04,860
called formula 69 a formula 69 all right

122
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:06,920
you people are into some seriously kinky

123
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:09,720
shit down here mm-hmm

124
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:11,400
well you see we've managed to isolate a

125
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:14,970
pheromone that's only detectable to

126
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:18,420
females and although odorless and

127
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:20,970
colorless it induces extreme sexual

128
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:23,340
arousal and pleasurable endorphins when

129
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:25,830
inhaled thus clouding the judgment of

130
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:28,110
any female and when mixed with any

131
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:31,380
standard men's cologne it becomes an

132
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:33,090
invaluable tool to our male agents to

133
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:37,950
stracke and obtain information from

134
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:43,160
would be females acids mm-hmm God all

472
01:37:42,480 --> 01:37:46,170
rubbing it in my face

473
01:37:43,500 --> 01:37:49,190
there was a sensitive man there just

474
01:37:46,170 --> 01:37:49,190
briefed Rachel now would you

475
01:37:51,910 --> 01:37:55,760
well as you know this islands the

476
01:37:54,260 --> 01:37:58,610
smallest of the group belonging to North

477
01:37:55,760 --> 01:38:00,290
Korean leader jong-il now a british

478
01:37:58,610 --> 01:38:01,970
intel has informed us that he has hidden

479
01:38:00,290 --> 01:38:06,020
some sort of weapon here in preparing

480
01:38:01,970 --> 01:38:08,780
for attack we've been using satellite

481
01:38:06,020 --> 01:38:10,750
imagery to scan the terrain for any

482
01:38:08,780 --> 01:38:16,940
photographic evidence of anything

483
01:38:10,750 --> 01:38:19,660
man-made existing out here so we began

484
01:38:16,940 --> 01:38:22,730
searching the island on for two days go

485
01:38:19,660 --> 01:38:26,540
thinking perhaps jong-il had stashed the

486
01:38:22,730 --> 01:38:30,560
weapons in a cave but so far we've had

487
01:38:26,540 --> 01:38:33,820
no luck have you guys consider the

488
01:38:30,560 --> 01:38:47,420
possibility that maybe it's underground

489
01:38:33,820 --> 01:38:50,120
no money yes okay here I'll hack into

490
01:38:47,420 --> 01:38:53,240
one of the u.s. heat-seeking satellite

491
01:38:50,120 --> 01:38:55,750
repositioned it to scan this island see

492
01:38:53,240 --> 01:38:55,750
