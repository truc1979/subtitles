2
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,710
Gosh Bruce!

3
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,710
I'm stuck!

4
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,270
This game might be too advanced for a young boy, Bruce.

5
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,270
It's actually quite rudimentary, Lisa.

6
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,270
All you have to do is think...

7
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:43,270
...16 moves ahead.

8
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,270
That's all.

9
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,890
Well, I'll leave you two to your past time.

10
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:51,670
Tomorrow, my father is hosting that, umm...

11
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:56,040
...fundraiser for the deaf children with the blind parents.

12
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:59,560
The seamstress is coming to do my wardrobe.

13
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,790
Poor, poor children.  Destiny is quite unkind to them to say the least.

14
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:10,040
As long as they're fine individuals.

15
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,040
Such as your father.

16
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,040
I'm sure they would never lose hope.

17
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:16,040
So go along dear.

18
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:18,040
I'll see you for dinner.

19
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:20,040
[kiss]

20
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:38,220
Riddle me this, Miss Carson!

21
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:40,930
What is the difference between you...

22
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:42,930
...and Bruce Wayne's...

23
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:45,590
...bank account?

24
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:49,010
There is no difference.

25
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:51,010
You both pique his...

26
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:52,010
...interest.

27
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,750
[screams]

28
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:03,060
Bruce!  Did you hear that?

29
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,730
Yes.

30
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:08,560
And judging by the time of day, it's probably Alfred...

31
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,560
...groping Aunt Harriet.

32
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,950
Holy Viagra!

33
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:17,130
Commissioner Gordon...

34
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:18,620
...somebody left an envelope for you.

35
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,620
Well thank you dear.

36
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:28,810
The Riddler!

37
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:32,020
He's kidnapped Lisa Carson, the famous heiress.

38
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,100
The pompous...

39
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:39,360
...worldly master of foul play.

40
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:43,940
Are you thinking what I think you're thinking?

41
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,940
I'm afraid I am.

42
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:50,130
The devil with pride, Chief!

43
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:53,630
There's only but one man living that can stop him.

44
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:57,880
Whoever he may be behind that mask of his...

45
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,880
...our only hope...

46
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,880
...the Cape Crusader.

47
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:10,470
Master Wayne the phone is ringing.

48
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:16,240
Thank you Alfred, but I'm...quite busy with this challenging game.

49
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:20,220
Sir, it's the...special phone.

50
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:34,240
Holy checkmate!

51
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,580
Yes, Commissioner.

52
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:45,850
Sorry to deserve you Batman.  We have an emergency.

53
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,120
The Riddler's on the loose.

54
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,730
He's kidnapped Bruce Wayne's girlfriend.

55
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,730
Surely you must be jesting.

56
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,200
Alas, I am not.

57
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,200
We haven't time to lose.

58
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:05,960
To the Bat pole.

59
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,740
I turned the batteries to power!  Turbines to speed!

60
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,020
Hello!

61
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,060
Look.

62
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,060
You don't have to hold me captive.

63
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:26,120
My father is very wealthy.

64
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,630
And my fiance' is Bruce Wayne!

65
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:32,140
They'll pay whatever ransom you desire.

66
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,970
So....

67
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:48,130
...the kind of ransom I want your father cannot pay.

68
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,520
Riddle me this, Miss Carson.

69
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,150
When is cheese bad for a mouse?

70
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:01,350
When...it's in a trap.

71
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:05,670
And you, Miss Carson, are the cheese.

72
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:08,960
And Batman... is... my....

73
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,690
...fat....rat...

74
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:17,370
[laughing]

75
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:21,290
Well this bed looks awfully uncomfortable.

76
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,170
Don't you have any better accommodations?

77
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,170
I would be...

78
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:29,000
...very....appreciative.

79
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:42,920
Perhaps a softer mattress can be negotiated.

80
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:47,760
[laughs]

81
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:59,000
[laughing]

82
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:06,520
You don't want a mattress that bad?

83
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:45,920
Oh, god, you're big!

84
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,530
Bruce isn't.

85
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,400
Have you met these?

86
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:04,040
I wanna slip into something a little more comfortable.

87
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,240
Unzip me.

88
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,460
[giggles]

89
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:21,210
That's better.

90
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,320
That's a dirty mouth.

91
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,020
A cock in my mouth.

92
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:07,250
I'm such a dirty girl.

93
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,750
Where else do you wanna put your cock?

94
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:24,350
Huh, Riddler?  Hmm?

95
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,480
Riddle me this?

96
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:34,390
When is a pussy like a flower?

97
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,710
When?

98
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,120
When it has...

99
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,260
...too lips!

100
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,750
[laughing]

101
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:45,780
Ohh!  Harder.

102
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,860
Oh, you're perverted!

103
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,360
Oh, you're perverted.

104
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,910
Oh, this is so wrong!

105
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,910
Oh, this is so wrong!

106
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,010
More.

107
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,840
I wanna sit on that.

108
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:14,920
Yes, stick that pussy out there!

109
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:02,810
Oh, my.... Be careful...Be careful with that thing!

110
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:21,000
You put all that pretty cock...you put all that pretty cock in my butt?

111
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:39,450
I know it's so small.  And you fuck my pussy so good.

112
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,660
...for you?

113
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:55,020
Oh, my asshole knows your cock so well.

114
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:03,860
Oh, I'm so tight!

115
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,460
I will get your cum.  Oh, yes.

116
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:52,120
Oh, my...Oh, my...

117
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:06,330
Oh, it's driving me crazy!

118
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:32,580
It's so nice...

119
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:36,470
Am I gaping pretty for you?

120
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,230
Cum on my cock!

121
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:53,780
Commissioner, how's Ms Carson?

122
00:29:56,950 --> 00:30:02,540
That cowardly puzzler...he better not harm a hair on her head.

123
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:05,020
I take it you and Bruce Wayne are acquainted?

124
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:09,420
Yes, Mr. Wayne has graced me with his friendship and...

125
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:12,330
we've had meaningful conversations from time to time but....

126
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:15,080
...please, the stipulations on the ransom?

127
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,930
Well, Batman here's the thing...

128
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:21,590
...there is no ransom request.

129
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:24,970
Unprecedented!

130
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:29,290
I think I might know what it is he's after.

131
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:32,050
He wants us.

132
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:33,530
To come find you.

133
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:36,740
What a dastardly, twisted plot!

134
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:38,470
But Batman...

135
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:39,520
...that sounds like a trap!

136
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:43,610
Precisely Robin!  Which is why we now have an advantage.

137
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:46,600
I say we play along, but...

138
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,600
...cautiously.

139
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:53,710
I think I may have some information on the whereabouts of the Riddler.

140
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,990
Quick Robin! We haven't a moment to lose!

141
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:05,340
Holy gluteus maximus, Batman!

142
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:07,860
This Bat climb is sure hard on the buttocks.

143
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,480
Careful Robin.

144
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,930
Both hands on the Bat Rope.

145
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:12,490
Sorry Batman.

146
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,960
Batman and Robin!

147
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,960
What are you guys doing?

148
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,740
Holy hedgehog Batman!  Who is this?

149
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:24,030
Robin this is Ron Jeremy, without a doubt the hardest...

150
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:26,030
...working man in show business.

151
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:28,610
Women seem to find him strangely...

152
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:29,790
...irresistible.

153
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:32,510
Hey guys, why don't you take a break...

154
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:34,230
...and come have some fun inside?

155
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:36,220
Can't handle all these girls by myself.

156
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:39,230
I've got two free hands!

157
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:42,860
Very tempting but thanks.

158
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:46,160
Our pursuit of justice...allows us very few diversions.

159
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,650
But...by all means....

160
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:50,650
...carry on with your business, citizen.

161
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,470
Gosh Batman!

162
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:59,300
That Ron Jeremy sure has excellent taste in girls.

163
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:03,890
That single statement indicates to me the first oncoming thrust of manhood old chum.

164
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:06,550
Wait for me on the roof.

165
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,550
I'm gonna go inside.

166
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:10,550
Two masked crimefighters...

167
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:12,550
...walking into a discotheque could...

168
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,560
...draw some unwanted attention.

169
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:59,060
Oh, my god, it's Batman!

170
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:03,890
A large grapefruit juice please.  Yessir.

171
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:08,590
Are you looking for a friend?

172
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,620
I believe....

173
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:15,620
...you could say that.

174
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:18,850
I have a question.

175
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:22,810
How is a squabble like a bargain?

176
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:27,250
Very well.  It's because...

177
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,450
...it takes two to make it.

178
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:33,450
Hmm...

179
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:35,450
Do you like beautiful music?

180
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,270
Shall we?

181
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:44,740
What is your name?

182
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:46,740
Molly.

183
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:49,250
Here you go Batman.

184
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:51,250
Freshly squeezed.

185
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,580
Thank you.

186
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:01,230
You...

187
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:02,750
...entice me.

188
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:05,360
I accept your invitation to dance.

189
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:29,310
You shake a pretty mean cape, Batman.

190
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:31,310
This...it's nothing.

191
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:36,880
It's....

192
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:46,080
...spiked!

193
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:49,370
That's right, Batman, your drink is spiked.

194
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:55,140
The drug scopolamine is going to make you lose all of your willpower.

195
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:57,290
And the funny thing is...

196
00:34:57,290 --> 00:35:04,140
...you're gonna follow me back to where the Riddler has that heiress.

197
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,070
Lisa...

198
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:14,070
Yeah, Lisa Carson.

199
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:19,010
She's not even that pretty anyway.  I don't know what Bruce Wayne sees in her.

200
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:24,480
I...must...resist.

201
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,100
You can't resist Batman.

202
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:31,400
Your willpower is gone.  You're only going to take orders.

203
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:35,550
And in fact, I'm gonna have fun with you before you go.

204
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:44,290
Do you like that?

205
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:27,950
I'm drooling all over your cock.  Do you like that?

206
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,020
Stick that tongue out there.

207
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:18,460
I bet he's begging for this pussy.

208
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:43,930
You want it so bad.  Look at you.

209
00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:46,950
Look at you.

210
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,960
One more inch and you'll be in this pussy.

211
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:59,210
You want me to sit on it don't you.

212
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:21,810
Is that what you want?  Me to sit on that cock?

213
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:24,020
Worship my big ass.

214
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:27,630
Put your hand all over it.

215
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,680
Spank me.

216
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:47,250
Kiss me....Fuck me.

217
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:50,130
I wanna taste it!  I wanna taste.

218
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:14,410
Oh, you wanna put that cock in my wet pussy?

219
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:22,020
That pussy is so juicy!

220
00:47:29,490 --> 00:47:31,150
Fuck me like that.

221
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:33,790
Fuck me!

222
00:47:55,770 --> 00:47:58,510
Oh, stick it back in.  Stick it back in that pussy!

223
00:48:14,390 --> 00:48:17,620
Oh, yes!  I wanna cum!

224
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:20,650
Oh, fuck me!

225
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:51,670
Back and forth.

226
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:54,840
You like that?  Yeah.

227
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:05,040
You like when that pussy fucks you back, don't you?

228
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:09,430
You want me to take that cock from you, stroke by stroke?

229
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,880
Keep your cock right there.

230
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:50,850
Oh, no, no, no.  You're going to cum in my mouth.

231
00:56:52,150 --> 00:56:55,050
Blow your bat right in my mouth.

232
00:58:09,570 --> 00:58:12,410
Now let's get going.  I got to find your dumb heiress.

233
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:19,460
Commissioner!  Batman's gone!

234
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:21,160
What?!  Batman is gone?

235
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:24,030
Yes!  I'm afraid he's been kidnapped by the Riddler.

236
00:58:24,030 --> 00:58:27,620
Excuse me Barbara.  We have an emergency here.  Oh.

237
00:58:28,870 --> 00:58:31,920
Don't worry, Daddy.  I understand.  Love you.

238
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,920
Love you too, dear.

239
00:58:38,290 --> 00:58:40,550
A thought strikes me.

240
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:42,550
So dreadful...

241
00:58:42,550 --> 00:58:46,260
I scarcely dare give it utterance.

242
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:50,190
Could this be the end of Batman?

243
00:59:01,660 --> 00:59:05,140
Holy transformation!

244
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:09,450
One minute she's plain Barbara Gordon....

245
00:59:09,450 --> 00:59:11,450
...librarian...

246
00:59:11,450 --> 00:59:12,880
...and the next...

247
00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:17,210
Looks like you guys can use some help.

248
00:59:17,210 --> 00:59:18,000
BatGirl!

249
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:22,480
For heaven sakes, BatGirl we can use all the help we can get right now.

250
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:24,630
Commissioner, I believe I have an idea.

251
00:59:24,630 --> 00:59:27,910
You wanna catch a criminal, the best person to ask is...

252
00:59:27,910 --> 00:59:29,100
...another criminal!

253
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:32,120
That's right, Robin!  And I think I know where to find one.

254
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:34,120
Follow me!

255
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:46,610
I use my Bat Scanner to pinpoint the possible hideaways of the Joker.

256
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:49,100
Something tells me...

257
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:51,550
...he knows where we can find... the Riddler.

258
00:59:51,550 --> 00:59:53,550
Holy free fall, BatGirl.

259
00:59:53,550 --> 00:59:54,740
I got you.

260
00:59:55,210 --> 01:00:00,500
Is that a battery in your pocket or are you just happy to save me?

261
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:05,320
I...I...make sure to have both hands on the rod.

262
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:08,140
Rope!  Rope!

263
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:12,540
The Riddler will be arriving soon.

264
01:00:12,540 --> 01:00:14,540
With the masked fool.

265
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:16,540
And silly heiress.

266
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:37,190
I'll get rid of Batman and Robin for good!

267
01:00:37,190 --> 01:00:39,190
Holy conspiracy!

268
01:00:41,860 --> 01:00:44,840
[laughs]

269
01:00:47,690 --> 01:00:49,330
The Joker!

270
01:00:50,510 --> 01:00:52,070
King!

271
01:00:52,070 --> 01:00:55,040
Of all super criminals.

272
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:59,930
[laughs]

273
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:03,350
Gotham first, I think!

274
01:01:03,350 --> 01:01:05,350
Then...

275
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:09,250
...the world!

276
01:01:09,250 --> 01:01:11,250
[laughs]

277
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:16,920
Curb your tongue, funny man.

278
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:20,550
You and I...we have a deal

279
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:24,020
But of course.

280
01:01:24,020 --> 01:01:26,550
My feline friend.

281
01:01:28,170 --> 01:01:30,780
You can have your way with the dynamic duo.

282
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:34,130
Just before I destroy them...[laughs]

283
01:01:42,810 --> 01:01:46,340
We're waiting for the winged caped crusader.

284
01:01:47,190 --> 01:01:49,890
Perhaps we could warm up a bit.

285
01:01:49,890 --> 01:01:52,810
Uh...please Joker!

286
01:01:52,810 --> 01:01:55,930
The mere thought perturbs me!

287
01:01:55,930 --> 01:01:57,930
Besides....

288
01:01:57,930 --> 01:02:02,860
I have a more infinitely fiendish plan for them...

289
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:08,190
Very well.  Have it your way.

290
01:02:08,190 --> 01:02:11,980
There is more than one way to skin a cat.

291
01:02:12,580 --> 01:02:13,980
Woman...

292
01:02:14,850 --> 01:02:16,250
Now get out!

293
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:21,410
I need to relax before the Grand Finale!  [laughs evilly]

294
01:02:28,270 --> 01:02:30,560
Would you like a massage, Joker?

295
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:33,330
How about a full body rub down?

296
01:02:33,740 --> 01:02:38,340
Both ideas sound smashing, acutally.

297
01:02:49,950 --> 01:02:52,900
Oh yes!

298
01:02:55,180 --> 01:02:56,880
What the heck!

299
01:02:59,390 --> 01:03:00,700
Cover your eyes, BatGirl!

300
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:02,700
This spectacle is not for a lady.

301
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:06,250
Don't be silly, Robin, it's hot!

302
01:03:30,930 --> 01:03:35,530
Let me be your personal go-go dancer.  Yes, yes, let me see that!

303
01:03:35,530 --> 01:03:39,310
Pretty, pretty.

304
01:03:58,690 --> 01:04:01,350
Going to suck your dick good.

305
01:04:05,490 --> 01:04:08,530
She sucks it real good!

306
01:04:15,670 --> 01:04:19,320
Let me taste that cock!

307
01:05:04,390 --> 01:05:06,510
Oh, Joker!

308
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:48,170
I know what you like.

309
01:05:50,810 --> 01:05:53,400
You make my pussy so wet!

310
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:45,430
Tast yourself on it.

311
01:08:14,750 --> 01:08:17,720
Are you gonna ride that dick?  Oh, yeah

312
01:08:46,130 --> 01:08:48,880
It feel good in your pussy?

313
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:50,680
It's so big!

314
01:08:56,810 --> 01:08:59,040
I love to watch you fuck!

315
01:10:17,990 --> 01:10:20,340
She's such a dirty girl!

316
01:10:22,330 --> 01:10:23,560
More cock for you?

317
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:24,870
Yes, more cock please.

318
01:10:27,850 --> 01:10:31,290
More cock for me.

319
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:11,000
Shove it back inside me.

320
01:12:08,670 --> 01:12:10,840
Oh, fuck me!

321
01:12:20,930 --> 01:12:24,770
Oh, my goodness, put it inside my tiny twat.

322
01:13:11,380 --> 01:13:14,550
It's so deep inside my pussy!

323
01:13:14,550 --> 01:13:16,900
It's such a good view!

324
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:21,520
You like being in this little whore hole?

325
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:23,520
Yeah.

326
01:13:30,650 --> 01:13:32,920
Your cock feels so nice!

327
01:14:46,410 --> 01:14:49,740
Oh, come on, fuck me Joker.

328
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:24,910
Get down here, I'm coming on your faces.

329
01:16:32,010 --> 01:16:35,880
Now remember, remember...

330
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:38,800
I want you to smile when you take the load.

331
01:16:40,170 --> 01:16:43,280
We always do!

332
01:17:10,230 --> 01:17:12,090
It tastes good.

333
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:23,610
Holy popshot!

334
01:17:24,180 --> 01:17:27,820
The Riddler better bring Batman soon, or...    Or what?

335
01:17:27,820 --> 01:17:30,970
You gonna show me why they call you Boy Wonder?

336
01:17:31,950 --> 01:17:33,430
Gee BatGirl!

337
01:17:33,430 --> 01:17:35,430
When you put it that way?

338
01:18:36,540 --> 01:18:38,730
Oh my god, Robin!

339
01:27:56,240 --> 01:27:58,570
I'm coming!  I'm coming!

340
01:27:58,570 --> 01:28:02,280
I wanna make myself cum!

341
01:28:29,340 --> 01:28:32,120
Give it to me!

342
01:29:03,260 --> 01:29:05,020
Very impressive, Boy Wonder!

343
01:29:05,020 --> 01:29:07,020
Looks like you let the bird out of the cage.

344
01:29:07,020 --> 01:29:08,790
Get him!

345
01:29:54,490 --> 01:29:56,270
Who better to complete your plan?...

346
01:29:56,270 --> 01:29:58,270
...than the Prince of Puzzles?!

347
01:29:58,270 --> 01:30:00,320
The King of Conundrum...

348
01:30:00,890 --> 01:30:03,510
...the Count of....

349
01:30:05,990 --> 01:30:10,650
It will just a matter of time...before my trusty sidekick figures out...

350
01:30:10,650 --> 01:30:12,410
...your dastardly plan!

351
01:30:12,410 --> 01:30:14,890
And comes for my rescue.

352
01:30:18,020 --> 01:30:20,390
Oh, really now!

353
01:30:22,210 --> 01:30:26,920
Tsk...tsk...and another tsk...

354
01:30:26,920 --> 01:30:28,160
Batman.

355
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:31,660
You witch!

356
01:30:33,420 --> 01:30:36,820
What?  With all your troubles...

357
01:30:36,820 --> 01:30:39,370
...still haven't learned good manners?

358
01:30:39,370 --> 01:30:44,900
A real gentleman would kiss a lady's paw.

359
01:30:44,900 --> 01:30:47,170
You are no lady.

360
01:30:47,170 --> 01:30:48,740
In fact, you....

361
01:30:48,740 --> 01:30:50,740
Batman!

362
01:30:50,740 --> 01:30:54,100
I cannot tolerate a man with no breeding.

363
01:30:54,100 --> 01:30:56,100
Enough of this child's play!

364
01:30:56,440 --> 01:30:59,690
This time.... the joke's on you!

365
01:31:00,180 --> 01:31:02,530
Silly crime fighters.

366
01:31:03,860 --> 01:31:04,870
[laughing]

367
01:31:04,870 --> 01:31:07,870
What deviltry are you up to this time, Joker?!

368
01:31:08,100 --> 01:31:12,170
One zap from my very funny ray gun...

369
01:31:13,460 --> 01:31:16,530
...and you're fini....caput....!

370
01:31:16,530 --> 01:31:18,430
...defunct!  Defunct!

371
01:31:21,780 --> 01:31:23,540
You won't get away with this so easy!

372
01:31:23,540 --> 01:31:25,540
Easily.

373
01:31:25,470 --> 01:31:28,520
Easily.  Good grammar is essential, Robin.

374
01:31:28,520 --> 01:31:30,280
Thank you, Batman.

375
01:31:30,280 --> 01:31:31,300
You're very welcome.

376
01:31:31,300 --> 01:31:32,790
Wait a second, Joker!

377
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:36,370
That was not the plan!

378
01:31:36,860 --> 01:31:38,700
Then the plan...

379
01:31:39,030 --> 01:31:40,700
...was a joke!

380
01:31:45,110 --> 01:31:47,620
Wait! Wait!  Wait!

381
01:31:47,620 --> 01:31:50,690
The rich lady...should bring a fine ransom.

382
01:31:50,690 --> 01:31:53,700
She'll bring lots of money!

383
01:31:53,700 --> 01:31:55,970
Who cares about a few dollars?

384
01:31:55,970 --> 01:32:01,250
When you can finally be rid of the masked menace!

385
01:32:07,140 --> 01:32:11,400
Wait!  Kill him first!

386
01:32:13,030 --> 01:32:15,490
I always hated that little fucker!

387
01:32:18,450 --> 01:32:25,060
Batman, your lips are so sexy when you're angry.

388
01:32:26,020 --> 01:32:29,870
Your eyes so dashing beneath that mask.

389
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:36,170
Just remember, you owe we me one.

390
01:32:37,580 --> 01:32:39,040
Riddle me this...

391
01:32:55,240 --> 01:32:56,940
Holy glass jaw, Batman!

392
01:32:59,060 --> 01:33:02,110
You can bring these nefarious criminals to justice, BatGirl.

393
01:33:02,110 --> 01:33:06,430
We will personally deal with our feline felinous.

394
01:33:11,400 --> 01:33:14,670
Thank you, Batman.  You are a remarkable man!

395
01:33:14,670 --> 01:33:16,670
Oh, it was nothing.  Nothing at all.

396
01:33:16,670 --> 01:33:19,580
In fact, I hear your fiance'...

397
01:33:19,580 --> 01:33:23,020
...Mr. Wayne, was quite the remarkable man himself?

398
01:33:23,020 --> 01:33:25,020
He is a remarkable man.

399
01:33:25,020 --> 01:33:27,600
You two have a lot of similar qualities.

400
01:33:28,010 --> 01:33:30,710
Thank you.  Thank you.

401
01:33:36,300 --> 01:33:37,910
Now it's your turn, CatWoman.

402
01:33:37,910 --> 01:33:43,440
Our duty as duly deputized officers of the law is to put you behind bars.  Nonetheless...

403
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:48,350
...your gesture shows there's some good left in your moral fiber.

404
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:50,930
But we are indeed indebted to her, Robin.

405
01:33:50,930 --> 01:33:53,500
She did save our lives.

406
01:33:53,500 --> 01:33:56,470
We should show leniency, but...

407
01:33:56,470 --> 01:34:00,070
Without compromising our moral principles.

408
01:34:00,850 --> 01:34:04,330
Holy dilemma, Batman!  What are we to do?!

409
01:34:05,860 --> 01:34:10,770
I think I have the purrfect solution!

410
01:34:16,500 --> 01:34:19,450
We must give credit where credit is due.

411
01:34:19,450 --> 01:34:23,970
She may be evil, but she is quite attractive.

412
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:26,950
Holy threesome, Batman?

413
01:34:26,950 --> 01:34:28,000
Indeed.

414
01:49:40,660 --> 01:49:45,210
'Yeah, I wanna get fucked!

415
01:56:28,380 --> 01:56:32,100
Yeah, I want it!  I want that Bat Cum!

416
01:57:24,900 --> 01:57:32,000
Your nice hard cocks cum all over my dirty, kitty face.

417
01:57:33,540 --> 01:57:37,650
That was very, very pleasing, Cat Woman, but...

418
01:57:37,650 --> 01:57:38,940
...it is time to go.

419
01:57:39,330 --> 01:57:41,330
Of  course, Bat Man, but....

420
01:57:41,330 --> 01:57:43,260
..give me a minute to freshen up.

421
01:57:43,260 --> 01:57:48,620
You wouldn't want the prison warden to see me all covered in your Bat Cum would you?

422
01:57:48,620 --> 01:57:52,850
Robin, she has a point, but do it in a timely manner.

423
01:57:52,850 --> 01:57:56,230
Of course.

424
01:57:57,840 --> 01:58:00,580
Well, you know what they say...

425
01:58:00,580 --> 01:58:02,580
...cats have 9 lives.

426
01:58:02,580 --> 01:58:05,490
Well, I hope bats have at least 2>

427
01:58:11,260 --> 01:58:14,290
CAN THIS BE IT FOR THE DYNAMIC DUO!

428
01:58:15,820 --> 01:58:18,400
LEARN THE AGONIZING ANSWER!

429
