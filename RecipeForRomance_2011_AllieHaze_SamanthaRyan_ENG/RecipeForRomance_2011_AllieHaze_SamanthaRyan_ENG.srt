2
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,920
We want to  impress our guests but they are very conservative people.

3
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,220
So you must not make anything too spicy.

4
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,860
Alright.  We can do that.

5
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,380
I can't stress the importance of that enough.

6
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:04,880
Nothing spicy.  But not bland either.

7
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,220
Bland and grand.  Got it.

8
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:08,900
I certainly hope so.

9
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:13,960
Since the success of my husband's business relies on the opinion of these people.

10
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,060
No pressure there.

11
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:20,560
I'm sure you'll do fine.  You come highly recommended.

12
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,040
In fact, you catered my friend's Dolores Beringer's wedding, and...

13
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,540
...and her husband was promoted to partner the very next day.

14
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:31,830
She swears up and down it was due to the success of the dinner.

15
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:36,140
Although, I couldn't understand what she was saying over all that giggling.

16
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:40,280
Anyway.  I'll leave you to your duties.  I'm sure you'll do fantastic.

17
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:07,360
Hors d'oeuvres?  Such a terrible word.

18
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,860
Hors d'oeuvre?  Can't you just call it a snack?

19
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,640
Since you're the head of the zoning commission, Gordon, ...

20
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:18,500
It's imperative we have you on board.  Or we can't even begin to build downtown.

21
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,360
My jobs are depending on that.

22
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,860
So I want to make sure we can depend on you.

23
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,360
I hear your point.

24
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,300
I really wish there was something I could do to help.

25
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,500
But unfortunately, my hands are tied.

26
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:38,400
You see my wife...she wouldn't go for that sort of business in our community.

27
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:41,900
All those writhing...sweaty bodies.

28
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,400
She'll say it's immoral.

29
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:53,920
It's a health club spa, Gordon.   It's not a whorehouse.

30
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,640
What can I say?

31
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,140
She says spandex is obscene.

32
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:05,070
With all due respect, Mr. Gordon, I think you're really missing the big picture here.

33
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:08,570
With all due respect, Mr. Fancy, you don't know my wife do you?

34
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:11,250
She's always been a bit of a cold fish, yes.

35
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,140
But I knew that when I married her.

36
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,600
You see after she gave birth to our first son....

37
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,100
She told me we would have to wait to have sex until she was ready.

38
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:22,600
So?  So?

39
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,940
My son finally left.

40
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,960
I think she's finally ready to have sex with me again.

41
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,460
I don't want anything to mess that up.

42
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,940
Your sons gone?  Where did he go?

43
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:37,440
College.

44
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:45,100
Yes.  I see.

45
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,520
You realize we been busy every night this week?

46
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,740
I know.  It's great.

47
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:56,320
The phone just keeps ringing.

48
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,820
Sorry been working you so hard.  It's the new business and all.

49
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,980
I'm not complaining.

50
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,480
I just need something to spend all this overtime money on.

51
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,380
Let's go get a drink after this.

52
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:10,880
Oh, you're funny.  You always say that.

53
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,920
But I'll probably just go home and work on some recipes.

54
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,740
Cook something.  Clean something.  Go to bed.

55
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,980
And you always say that.

56
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,840
You know you need to learn to balance...

57
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,760
...business and pleasure.

58
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,260
I don't have time for pleasure.

59
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:31,760
You make your own schedule, Caroline.

60
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:36,040
And the cycle continues.  Besides I like working.

61
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:41,460
I get to be the conductor to this little symphony of spices and flavors and textures.

62
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:45,660
With my wooden spoon as my baton I make music in people's mouths.

63
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:50,700
Yes.  You're the maestro and I'm your orchestra of one.

64
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,880
It's why we work so well together.

65
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,380
I'm telling you!

66
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:59,420
I already know that.

67
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:02,920
We work so well together, I don't think I could do this without you.

68
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,900
Well you could.

69
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,400
No! No. No.

70
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,900
Probably I could, but it wouldn't be nearly as much fun.

71
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,380
Wait!  Shh.  Listen.

72
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,720
Aaron, do you hear it?

73
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,380
What?

74
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,460
The drums!

75
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,880
What drums?

76
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,180
Shh.  Listen.

77
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:30,620
I think it's coming frommmmmm......

78
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:34,120
I hear them.  They're faint and distant.

79
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,720
They're calling to me.

80
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,220
Telling me that they want to come forward.  They want to be heard!

81
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:42,720
See if I add more spice...

82
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,770
They get even louder and..

83
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:46,650
...thumping!

84
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,660
Oh, natives are restless.

85
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:53,300
They are restless and I turn up the heat...

86
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,540
...and I add some wine.

87
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:59,040
It becomes a drunken, primal orgy!

88
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,540
Drunken Primal Orgy Soup.  That's what we should call it.

89
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:06,040
It's better than bouillabaisse.

90
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,880
Have you ever heard the term, "married to your work"?

91
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,140
Yes.  That's exactly it.

92
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,960
I am happily married to my work.

93
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,140
And lately it seems like I'm literally married to it.

94
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,020
What do you mean?

95
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,540
I don't know exactly, but...

96
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,620
...ever since we've been catering, ...

97
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:28,600
...I've been having this vivid recurring daydream.

98
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,780
Fantasy!  Right.

99
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:35,280
Sometimes when I'm cooking...

100
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,780
...I imagine a man coming up from behind me...

101
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:42,280
...he gently places his arms around me...

102
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,880
...he sweeps the hair from my neck and kisses me...

103
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:51,920
He whispers in my ear.  He ravishes me right there!

104
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,660
And when we're done...I snap out of it

105
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,680
My meal is finished.

106
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,120
I barely remember cooking it.

107
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,100
Like my subconscious is trying to tell me something.

108
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:06,440
Yeah.  You know it is trying to tell you something.

109
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,280
It's trying to tell you that you're horny.

110
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,780
It's definitely more powerful than that.

111
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:18,040
Something happened.  It's like the spices got a magical boost.

112
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,100
I mean.  You've seen the effects of some of my creations.

113
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:25,140
Yeah I have.  It has a really ecstatic effect on people.

114
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:28,640
You're like the master of deliciousness!

115
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,840
You're so funny.

116
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:34,680
No serious.  It has like an aphrodisiac effect on people.

117
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:40,120
Seriously though, I think it's just trying to tell me that...

118
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,620
...the right guy is out there.  Just keep being patient.

119
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,520
Mental patient.

120
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,020
Shut up!

121
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:52,520
So what does he look like...this fantasy man.

122
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,600
Well, I don't know exactly, cause...

123
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,380
...he's usually behind me and...he wears a mask.

124
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:02,980
Seriously, you're dreaming about doggie style with the Lone Ranger?

125
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:06,480
Alright, Tonto!

126
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:10,260
Let's finish up and you need to come get a drink with me and cut loose.

127
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,760
And you need to cut vegetables.

128
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,260
Get back to work smart Aleck.  See if I ever tell you anything personal.

129
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,220
Hey, come on!

130
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:21,840
Ah, I totally will.

131
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,340
OK, I'm going to get another pepper.

132
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:21,370
Carolina.  Carolina.

133
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:24,870
Carolina!  Hey!  Carolina!

134
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,370
Is this what you were talking about?

135
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:31,870
You've been on autopilot for awhile.  You OK?

136
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:35,370
Yeah, I'm fine.

137
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,870
And the first course is ready.

138
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:47,040
So I asked him, you know, what kind of curtain you going to put up in this building...

139
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,600
Curtain?  I'm just a building engineer.  I've got no idea...

140
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,420
So I...told him it's the outside facade that goes on the building.

141
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:59,610
Right, but this is no place for work in the den.

142
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:03,110
But that's just a whole other story in itself.

143
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:07,580
Gordon.  What I really wanted to talk with you about...

144
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,540
...is I have some proposals for you.

145
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:14,200
...on what my business has done for the whole Springfield community.

146
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,820
How it saved the local community.

147
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:20,320
Yeah, I think that matter is about closed.

148
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,700
Oh, well, let's just save this business talk for after dinner, boys.  OK?

149
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:29,200
How is your soup tasting, Prudence?

150
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,700
It's, um, very nice.

151
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:38,720
Quite nice!

152
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,620
It's just so hot.  Hot?

153
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,520
Oh no.

154
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:50,260
I specifically told the chef, nothing spicy.

155
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:53,760
I'm just...so hungry.

156
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,260
Finish your soup, honey.

157
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:01,260
Mmmmm.

158
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,580
Honey.

159
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:26,380
Just like that.  I love you so much.

160
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:30,120
Oh, that tickles.

161
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,960
Go slowly. Go slowly.

162
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:05,320
I had a wonderful time!

163
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,760
You have such a beautiful home!

164
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,430
Mr. Fancing.

165
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:10,610
You can count on my vote.

166
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:13,900
Thank you very much sir.  I know I can.

167
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,550
Y'all drive safe.

168
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,640
Have a good night.

169
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:35,490
Here is your payment for tonight's dinner.

170
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:38,630
And I included a very large tip.

171
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:40,030
Thank you.

172
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:41,860
No thank you.

173
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:44,130
Just one more little thing.

174
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:44,870
Yes.

175
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:48,370
Could I get the recipe for that delicious soup.

176
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:51,350
Oh.  Ah.

177
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:55,860
Sure.  I just kind of throw it together on the fly, but...

178
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:58,300
...sure I'll give you what I have.  Absolutely.

179
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,880
OK.  Thank you so much.

180
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,180
You're welcome.

181
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:10,310
Alright.

182
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:20,940
You know, I've got this.  You should go out, have some fun.

183
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:21,800
Well,...

184
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:25,560
I'll stay around, help you clean up.  Then you can come do something fun with me.

185
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:31,080
You're sweet, but I think I'll just go home and get ready for tomorrow's job.

186
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:36,130
Alright, well I can come help you get ready.

187
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:40,440
It's OK. You should go out and have that drink you were talking about.

188
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,940
My roommate's home.  She can help me.

189
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:48,570
You know, it wasn't the drink I was after.  It was the company.

190
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:55,780
You know, I can't believe I didn't see this before.

191
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:59,290
Finally, OK.

192
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:02,790
My roommate is the same age as you...

193
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:06,030
...and she's single and she's absolutely adorable...

194
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:07,760
I should introduce you two.

195
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,370
Are you kidding me?

196
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:12,870
No, I'm serious.  You would love her.

197
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:17,540
You know...you really don't get it do you.

198
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:20,090
I think I am going to take off.

199
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:23,590
I'll see you later.

200
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,850
I'm telling you, you would love him.

201
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:36,590
He's cute and funny.

202
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:39,110
And he's so sweet.

203
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:42,610
And he's got a really, really hot body.

204
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:46,110
Well, then, why don't you date him?

205
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:50,760
Because, he's too young.

206
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:54,260
He's the same age as me and you live with me.

207
00:27:56,550 --> 00:28:00,980
Because we work together, and that's a recipe for disaster.

208
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:03,390
I'm just being realistic.

209
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,150
Realistic?

210
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:08,650
Like holding out for dream date Zorro?

211
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:12,150
I guess.

212
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:14,690
Hey, it's not done yet.

213
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:18,190
Whatever.  Your loss of sanity is my gain.

214
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:20,180
When do I get to meet him?

215
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:22,650
Well....

216
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:25,400
He didn't seem to be feeling well when he left so...

217
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,900
I was thinking of baking him a cake and bringing it to him tomorrow.

218
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:31,230
You can come with me.

219
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:33,660
That sounds like a terrible idea.

220
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:36,610
Well, what else have you got to lose.

221
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:40,110
If all else fails, there will still be cake.

222
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:41,950
Whatever.

223
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,280
Why is he so down in the dumps?

224
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:06,780
It's a classic tale of unrequited love.

225
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:10,280
Oh, well you should stay late and tell me about it some time.

226
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:13,780
Yeah, sometime.

227
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:21,940
Come on man!  What are you blind?

228
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,940
The bartender was totally hitting on you.

229
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:27,440
I'm not interested.

230
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,360
Please tell me you're gay.

231
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,000
Why?

232
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,240
Cause the only way you couldn't be interested in her is if you were dead.

233
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:38,170
And I'll still need this half of the rent.

234
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:40,190
That's compassionate.

235
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:43,690
She's got you blind, dead, and gay, dude.

236
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:48,210
Just get up and move on.  She doesn't like you like that.

237
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:50,730
How many times can you ask someone out?

238
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:53,990
In a new and creative way, just to have her turn you down.

239
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:57,490
First she's too busy.  Then she's too crazy.

240
00:32:57,490 --> 00:33:00,990
Listen to what she's telling you.

241
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:08,770
She keeps telling me she's not interested, but her eyes are telling a different story.

242
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:12,270
Fine.  Listen to her eyes then.

243
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,770
Hey guys we're closing up.

244
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:20,650
But my apartment is right around the corner if you wanna...

245
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:24,150
...keep the party going?

246
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,770
Yeah, I'd like to but...

247
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:33,800
...unfortunately I have to get old Eyor home safe before he loses his tail.

248
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,590
Suit yourself.

249
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:38,090
C'mon Captain Cock Block.

250
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:48,920
Hey there.

251
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:51,140
Happy Birthday.

252
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:53,230
Wow.  Hey.

253
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:57,020
Oh, my birthday is not for a couple of months.

254
00:33:57,020 --> 00:34:00,090
But, ah, thank you.

255
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:03,590
That's not weird at all.

256
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:09,680
It's the middle of the afternoon.  I didn't think we'd be waking you.

257
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,950
No, I wasn't asleep.

258
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:16,340
I was, yes, I was asleep, but that's OK.

259
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:21,870
Charlie!

260
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:25,370
This is Carolina.  THE Carolina?

261
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:28,870
Oh, damn.  Nice.

262
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:32,370
I mean, nice to meet you.  I'm Charlie.

263
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:35,870
That's smooth, Charlie.  That's smooth.

264
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:39,230
And this is...uh.  This is my roommate, Adele.

265
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:42,730
I told you about her last night.

266
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:45,930
Nice meeting you.  I'm going to hit the shower.

267
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:49,850
OK.  Well.  Well. She's amazing.

268
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:53,350
Uh.  I don't think we have any plates.

269
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:55,780
We have plates.

270
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:01,790
Let me just cut you a slice.

271
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:07,460
Thank you.

272
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,240
There you go.

273
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,040
Well. Well. Would you look at the time?

274
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,730
I have a meeting, I forgot I'm late for.

275
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:22,230
Aaron could you please give Adele home?  I have to go.

276
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:35,770
She's a great chef.  You should really try this cake.

277
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:39,890
Yeah.  She's ah, amazing, yeah, I know that.

278
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:42,960
Mmm Hmm.

279
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:48,980
She told me that you were...

280
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:52,480
...hot, but ah,....

281
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,980
...I didn't know how hot you were.

282
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:58,510
Thank you.

283
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:00,160
Look, ah....

284
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,320
You sure you don't want to try some of this cake?

285
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:06,820
I really am all right.  Thanks though.

286
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,840
You seem really nice.

287
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:16,910
But...I am gonna go put some pants on.

288
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:20,410
And I'll drive you home.

289
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:23,490
Maybe you should put some pants on to.

290
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:52,800
Hi.

291
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,300
Hi.

292
00:36:57,710 --> 00:36:59,580
You wanna try some?

293
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:01,600
Hell yeah!

294
00:55:27,810 --> 00:55:31,680
So, how'd you like the cake that I made?

295
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:34,030
I didn't have any.

296
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:37,530
What!  Why?  I made it especially for you guys.

297
00:55:37,530 --> 00:55:41,030
I know you did, and I really don't appreciate that.

298
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:45,520
You don't appreciate me cooking for you?

299
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:48,100
You know what I'm talking about.

300
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:50,070
No, I don't know what you're talking about.

301
00:55:50,070 --> 00:55:55,800
You think you can trick me into having a relationship with your house mate?

302
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:57,570
Trick you?

303
00:55:57,570 --> 00:56:01,350
I was doing something nice by introducing you to somebody I thought you might like.

304
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,010
You don't listen to me.

305
00:56:04,010 --> 00:56:06,760
There's already someone I'm interested in.

306
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:11,440
And you putting someone in between is you being selfish.

307
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:15,140
Selfish?!  Maybe you're the one being selfish.

308
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:20,830
I try to be nice about it.  But you...don't...listen to me either.

309
00:56:22,870 --> 00:56:24,440
Is everything alright?

310
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:26,850
Yes. Yes.

311
00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:29,570
I thought I saw a mouse.  But it wasn't a mouse.

312
00:56:29,570 --> 00:56:30,770
Oh, OK.

313
00:56:30,770 --> 00:56:32,260
It was a rat.

314
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:33,380
I'm sorry?

315
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:36,880
I like your hat...hair.

316
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,470
Thank you.

317
00:57:13,450 --> 00:57:15,610
Happy anniversary, darling.

318
00:57:15,610 --> 00:57:18,070
Happy anniversary.

319
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:24,240
I got you something really special.

320
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:33,290
Ooooh.

321
00:57:33,290 --> 00:57:36,790
This chicken is delicious.  Have you tried it?

322
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:40,290
Oh yeah.  You know I like doing my veggie spears.

323
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:45,760
We all know you are a picky eater, Ramone.

324
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:48,560
Just eat the damn meat!

325
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:50,350
What's gotten into you?

326
00:57:50,350 --> 00:57:52,450
Don't act like you don't know, Ramone.

327
00:57:52,450 --> 00:57:54,250
I don't know.

328
00:57:54,250 --> 00:57:56,240
You're being selfish, Ramone.

329
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:57,860
I am?

330
00:57:57,860 --> 00:58:01,730
You're saying you have a special present for me, but I have to wait.

331
00:58:01,730 --> 00:58:02,960
I just meant....

332
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:06,460
You know what?  I don't want to wait.

333
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:09,960
I want...my present...now!

334
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:11,760
OK.

335
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:14,810
I know there's a lot of things you don't like to eat first.

336
00:58:14,810 --> 00:58:16,610
But your wife shouldn't be one of them.

337
00:58:16,610 --> 00:58:19,130
On your knees, boy!

338
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:53,100
It's amazing!  Yes.

339
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:32,130
We haven't done this in forever.

340
01:11:23,740 --> 01:11:25,760
What's gotten into you?

341
01:11:28,030 --> 01:11:29,740
I like it.

342
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:12,760
Happy Anniversary.  Happy Anniversary.

343
01:14:09,150 --> 01:14:13,290
Hey sexy!

344
01:14:29,270 --> 01:14:32,770
You were a pretty sad drunk the other night.

345
01:14:32,770 --> 01:14:35,880
Yeah.  Now I'm an angry one.

346
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:40,030
Ah.  Still pining away?

347
01:14:40,030 --> 01:14:44,010
No.  I think I'm done with all that sad shit.

348
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:47,510
I get it.  I'm taking the hint.

349
01:14:47,510 --> 01:14:51,010
Good.  Forget her.

350
01:14:51,010 --> 01:14:55,800
You know. I was planning on driving to Vegas for the weekend.

351
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:58,630
Do you wanna come with?

352
01:14:58,630 --> 01:15:02,130
Oh...Come on.

353
01:15:02,130 --> 01:15:08,130
It will be fun.  You can sit around here and mope and sigh all weekend or you can hit the highway with me.

354
01:15:08,130 --> 01:15:11,630
We can drink and laugh and fuck for days!

355
01:15:11,630 --> 01:15:15,130
I don't know.  Come on do it!

356
01:15:15,130 --> 01:15:18,250
She doesn't care if you're there.  She doesn't wan to be with you.

357
01:15:18,250 --> 01:15:21,020
I do.

358
01:15:22,250 --> 01:15:24,520
OK.  Alright.

359
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:31,610
Alright.  Uhmm.  Meet back here in 2 hours.

360
01:15:31,610 --> 01:15:35,110
Works for me.

361
01:16:14,230 --> 01:16:18,880
Thank god you're here.  I was starting to worry you weren't going to come.

362
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:21,770
Ah, I'm not staying.

363
01:16:21,770 --> 01:16:23,840
Oh no.  Are you sick?

364
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:27,230
Yeah.  Sick and tired.

365
01:16:28,130 --> 01:16:29,870
Not again Aaron.

366
01:16:30,430 --> 01:16:36,680
Yeah, not ever again.  I actually met somebody, and...

367
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:43,010
...she's great and she thinks I'm great.  So we're going  to go be great together.

368
01:16:43,630 --> 01:16:46,510
Well that's just great!

369
01:16:48,110 --> 01:16:53,570
I'm serious Carolina, unless there's anything you wanna say.

370
01:16:54,330 --> 01:16:56,540
I could really use your help.

371
01:16:58,930 --> 01:17:01,250
Yeah, that's what I thought.

372
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:06,580
Later.

373
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:09,430
Later.  When?

374
01:17:09,430 --> 01:17:15,740
Later, never.  You can consider this my resignation.

375
01:18:13,010 --> 01:18:17,470
Carolina!  Carolina.

376
01:18:17,470 --> 01:18:20,970
Carolina, are you OK?

377
01:18:21,730 --> 01:18:23,720
You look like you're a million miles away.

378
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:27,220
I'm fine.  I'm just putting finishing touches on the eggplant parmigiana.

379
01:18:27,220 --> 01:18:30,720
Good because the guests are getting hungry.

380
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:33,640
I have to go.

381
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:34,930
Excuse me?

382
01:18:34,930 --> 01:18:37,310
I'm sorry, but I have to go.

383
01:18:37,310 --> 01:18:41,090
I have to stop the man I love from being..."great".

384
01:18:41,090 --> 01:18:42,830
But what about my party?!

385
01:18:42,830 --> 01:18:45,990
And the man I love?  It's my husband's birthday!

386
01:18:45,990 --> 01:18:48,990
Everything...everything you need is here.

387
01:18:48,990 --> 01:18:52,490
Everything is ready.  You just have to serve yourselves.

388
01:18:52,490 --> 01:18:55,240
And I want even charge you for tonight either.

389
01:18:55,240 --> 01:19:00,930
It's on the house.  But I have to go and stop him.

390
01:19:00,930 --> 01:19:04,430
Run!  Good luck.

391
01:19:05,470 --> 01:19:07,930
Don't let him be great without you.

392
01:19:07,930 --> 01:19:11,430
Thank you.  Thank you.

393
01:19:11,430 --> 01:19:13,620
As a special present to you and your husband...

394
01:19:13,620 --> 01:19:17,120
...take my advice and have seconds on the eggplant parmigiana.

395
01:19:24,890 --> 01:19:27,880
Aaron!  Aaron!  Is Aaron here?

396
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:31,380
Nice to see you.  I wanted to thank you for that cake.

397
01:19:31,380 --> 01:19:33,430
You're welcome.  Is Aaron here?

398
01:19:33,430 --> 01:19:35,590
No he left about 20 minutes ago.

399
01:19:35,590 --> 01:19:37,300
Where did he go?

400
01:19:37,300 --> 01:19:38,780
Something about Vegas.

401
01:19:38,780 --> 01:19:40,520
What?

402
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:42,930
With that bartender chick...

403
01:19:42,930 --> 01:19:45,010
...from that joint around the corner.

404
01:19:45,010 --> 01:19:47,390
Oh my god!  Have they left yet?

405
01:19:47,890 --> 01:19:49,740
Yeah.

406
01:19:49,740 --> 01:19:51,670
Well where is he?

407
01:19:51,670 --> 01:19:54,360
He said he was going to leave his car at her place.

408
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:56,240
Where is her place?!

409
01:19:56,240 --> 01:19:59,740
I don't know.  Around the corner from the bar.

410
01:20:05,660 --> 01:20:07,530
What was that all about?

411
01:20:07,530 --> 01:20:08,660
I don't know.

412
01:20:08,660 --> 01:20:14,460
Maybe she figured out who the man behind the mask is.

413
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:35,630
Aaron!

414
01:21:35,630 --> 01:21:38,410
Aaron!  Aaron!  Don't go!  Whoa!

415
01:21:38,410 --> 01:21:41,910
Carolina, don't do this.

416
01:21:41,910 --> 01:21:45,410
You had a chance to stop me.

417
01:21:45,410 --> 01:21:47,370
I feel like a fool.

418
01:21:47,370 --> 01:21:50,330
I'm the fool  please.  I know that now.

419
01:21:50,330 --> 01:21:53,830
Please, please stay.

420
01:21:55,330 --> 01:21:57,330
Please.

421
01:21:58,300 --> 01:22:00,830
By Carolina.

422
01:22:07,940 --> 01:22:09,340
Gun it.

423
01:22:24,050 --> 01:22:26,660
But you're the Lone Ranger.

424
01:22:27,720 --> 01:22:29,990
You're my Lone Ranger.

425
01:22:29,990 --> 01:22:32,540
Oh god!
