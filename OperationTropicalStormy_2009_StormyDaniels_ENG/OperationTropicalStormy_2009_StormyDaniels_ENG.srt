11
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:27,600
Two months after (accidently) saving the world
and capturing evil terrorist leader Hussein,...

12
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,480
...George and his wife Rachel
were promoted to official agent status.

13
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:36,880
Just when life had returned to normal for the couple,
they received some troubling news...

14
00:02:02,229 --> 00:02:03,439
Don't worry.

15
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,149
Dr Harper is more-than-capable.

16
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,420
I'm just so scared for George.

17
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,930
Was this really necessary?

18
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:13,340
Absolutely.

19
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,840
Without a complete identity change,

20
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,330
your husband's life was in grave danger.

21
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,090
We received intel that after the capture of Hussein,

22
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,220
and angered four terrorist factions,

23
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,380
they put a price on his head.

24
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:30,950
I understand.

25
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:35,300
Yeah. It looks like he's almost done.

26
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,240
Do you want to go in and take a peek?

27
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,639
Yes.

28
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,220
Sir?

29
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,070
How much was it?

30
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,360
What?

31
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:46,039
The price on George's head?

32
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,100
Ah. Four dollars.

33
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,000
Four dollars?

34
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,490
Four dollars?

35
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Oh!

36
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,180
Excellent work, Doctor.

37
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,070
That's quite a transformation.

38
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:04,910
Yeah... this is incredible.

39
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,400
Who is this anyway?

40
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,510
Some famous porn star: Evan Stone.

41
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:18,700
Agent Z was quite insistent on his new face.

42
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,350
He also thought you'd appreciate... this.

43
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,180
Oh!

44
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:26,317
Holy shit.

45
00:03:26,317 --> 00:03:28,300
What is that?

46
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,270
A penis implant.

47
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,210
We had this special order,

48
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:35,040
the extra huge size he requested.

49
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,161
Look at the size of those testicles.

50
00:03:43,161 --> 00:03:44,351
Oh yeah...

51
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,490
Yes...!

52
00:03:45,961 --> 00:03:48,802
A curious side-effect I'm afraid.

53
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,239
After performing a
facelift at this magnitude,

54
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,049
we had so much extra skin...

55
00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:58,198
Frankly we didn't know
where else to put it so...

56
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,719
Hmmm.

57
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,090
Oh no waste, he's finally got some balls.

58
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,940
And he will be fully
functional in about 3 days.

59
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,230
Yes!

60
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,320
Yeah, while you're at it, Doc,

61
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,771
can you laser off those stupid tattoos?

62
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:25,020
Sure. Easy enough.

63
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:30,830
Woo.

64
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,080
Three days. Three days.

65
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,571
*Across the pond, British
agents Jacks and Watson*

66
00:04:48,571 --> 00:04:51,471
*have safely returned to
England where they continue*

67
00:04:51,471 --> 00:04:54,411
*to celebrate the success
of their mission*

68
00:04:54,411 --> 00:04:55,911
*the way dashing British
agents often do...*

69
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,730
Just as we thought we were done for it,

70
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,570
was to be the end of us,

71
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:11,250
there was a loud crashing sound...

72
00:05:12,539 --> 00:05:14,889
BANG! Missile come bursting
through the palace room,

73
00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:16,439
just missing us by inches.

74
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,600
Do you have any idea how difficult is to

75
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,000
operate a successful mission while

76
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,220
dressing with this garments?

77
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:28,660
What we was wearing is
inconsequential Watson.

78
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,180
I'd have to disagree, sir.

79
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,480
It's quite difficult to outrun
the hostiles in a skirt.

80
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,780
Enough Watson.

81
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:39,760
So there we were:

82
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,460
Battling our way through
the palace guards,

83
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,570
heavily outnumbered.

84
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,920
The bear in mind. We never
expected to make it out alive,

85
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,210
but still we battled on.

86
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,420
We fought away for the flames
and the falling debris.

87
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:55,250
Until we caught up with
the evil: terrorist Hussein.

88
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,600
To save the world from impending doom.

89
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,950
- And rescue the harem girls!
- Quite.

90
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:06,089
Now her Majesty the Queen
has decided to, Mr. Jacks and I,

91
00:06:06,089 --> 00:06:08,900
with the... utmost honor.

92
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,230
Yes, we ought to be
knighted tomorrow morning.

93
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:11,700
(Oooh...)

94
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:15,790
Can you believe that, man?

95
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,610
Sir Jacks. Sir Watson.

96
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,220
Yes.

97
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,830
Now, if you wouldn't...
excuse us ladies.

98
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,869
We need to get our rest
for tomorrow ceremonies.

99
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,160
- Slipper sir?
- Thank you, Watson.

100
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,300
Are you sure we can't
stay just a bit longer?

101
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:36,271
Perhaps we can help you
relax before the big event.

102
00:06:37,009 --> 00:06:39,819
Yes, I've never made it
with a knight before.

103
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:42,700
Well technically we're
not quite knight yet.

104
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,889
Shut up! Watson!

105
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,940
We certainly did rise
to the occasion.

106
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,490
George?

107
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,530
It's after 7:00 you better be up.

108
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,300
George?

109
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,290
If you make me late on my first
day as an agent,

110
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:39,720
I'll kill you myself.

111
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,150
[Whisper:] George?

112
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,420
George?

113
00:18:11,721 --> 00:18:13,881
[A bit louder:] George?

114
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,430
- [Loud:] George!
- Ah!

115
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,380
[*gunshot*]

116
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,980
What the fuck is wrong
with you?

117
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,670
George, you almost killed me!

118
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,160
Thought you were hostile.

119
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,530
Hostile? I'll show you "hostile" if
you don't get up.

120
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,800
Idiot!

121
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,930
What much (?)

122
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:45,140
Yeah, back in the day I was...
was quite the athlete.

123
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:48,429
It's pole vaulting around the room,
and... uh...

124
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:52,280
After the sex, well that's when she
actually knighted me.

125
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:57,020
It was quite ***

126
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,530
Agent Z?

127
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,561
I got a mission for you.

128
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,200
Go down and get me a cup of coffee.

129
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,210
[*Laughs*]

130
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:33,180
That just never gets old.

131
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:37,270
Take these authorization
forms down to the labs,

132
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:40,080
we can finalize testing on formula 69.

133
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,150
I will take that.

134
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:56,650
Ever mean to have a little "chat"
with Amy down in the lab.

135
00:20:56,819 --> 00:20:57,819
It's me to do it.

136
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,800
No. You remember what happened last time
we ventured down to

137
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,650
her little den of iniquity?

138
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,460
Stop thinking about it.

139
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,630
*** you pig.

140
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,009
It's gonna be a catfight.

141
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,870
Where are you, Amy?

142
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,920
You, little slut.

143
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,010
Where are you?

144
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,410
That's right.

145
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:21,190
You better hide.

146
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:25,140
You know who was gonna come down here
and kick some ass.

147
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,160
[*eeeew*]

148
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,341
That's interesting.

149
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,330
Hi!

150
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:41,340
Oh. You're not Amy.

151
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,911
No, uh, Amy's out in the field.

152
00:22:43,911 --> 00:22:46,481
She's collecting samples. She
won't be back until next week.

153
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:48,030
I'm her sister Martha.

154
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,809
Where are your pants?

155
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:54,310
Oh...

156
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,700
I'm working at a top-secret project
called "Formula 69".

157
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,960
Formula 69? All right...

158
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,750
You people are into some
seriously kinky shit down here.

159
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:06,920
Mm-hmm.

160
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:10,030
Well you see we've managed
to isolate a pheromone,

161
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:11,910
that's only detectable to females.

162
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:16,340
And also odorless and colorless.

163
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:19,140
It induces extreme sexual arousal,

164
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,670
and pleasurable endorphins when inhaled.

165
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:24,460
Thus clouding the judgment
of any female.

166
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,220
And when mixed with any
standard men's cologne,

167
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:30,759
it becomes an invaluable tool
to our male agents,

168
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:34,759
to stracke and obtain information
from would be females acids.

169
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,620
Hmmm... hmm.

170
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,400
God how you freaks the same.

171
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,601
Mumbo jumbo.

172
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:43,170
Well...

173
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:47,811
Thank you for the... chemistry lesson there,
Dr No-Pants.

174
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,011
But I think I'll be going back upstairs,

175
00:23:51,011 --> 00:23:53,361
where the sane people work.

176
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,500
[*spray*]

177
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,600
Now you don't really think that
that's gonna...

178
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:02,800
[*Martha laughs nervously*]

179
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,640
I... I... I didn't mean to actually...

180
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:09,550
Cause I'm not really into... aah...

181
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,130
So tell me...

182
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,781
Do you think your wife is
actually murdering Amy,

183
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,000
or just beating her beyond recognition?

184
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:40,960
Just a thought.

185
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:09,860
[*women moanings*]

186
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,030
Come on, come on... ah!

187
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:58,131
Hmm... yeah.

188
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,120
"You're my favourite fucking lab whore",
tell me!

189
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:08,671
You're my favourite fucking lab whore.

190
00:36:15,669 --> 00:36:17,769
Test formula complete.

191
00:36:17,769 --> 00:36:21,239
Subject reacted with optimal results.

192
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:51,941
(Hmmm)

193
00:36:51,941 --> 00:36:53,561
Wow, I see she got to you too.

194
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,630
Buckingham Palace - England

195
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,300
I can't believe it, sir.

196
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:18,730
I've got to pee again.

197
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,630
I told you not to drink so much
tea this morning.

198
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:33,380
[*They're smelling something*]

199
00:37:34,229 --> 00:37:35,939
What's that god-awful stench?

200
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,040
God, sir...

201
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,620
I've stepped in dog poop.

202
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:45,870
Oh my...

203
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:47,970
[*steps*]

204
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:49,060
Quick.

205
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,250
Hmm-hmm.

206
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:56,400
What should I do?

207
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:57,689
Lose the shoes, man.

208
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,090
- No!
- Yes, quick, lose the shoes.

209
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:01,180
Hurry up!

210
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,711
In remembrance of those given and received,

211
00:38:12,711 --> 00:38:17,211
and for outstanding service to
crown and the country,

212
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:19,521
and on behalf of the Commowealth,

213
00:38:19,521 --> 00:38:21,561
I hereby dub thee

214
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,880
Sir Marcus Jacks.

215
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:27,090
You may rise.

216
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,100
[*oooh*]

217
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,060
Agent Z, agent D,

218
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:57,950
there's an important satellite transmission
for you in the control room.

219
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,690
It's the President.

220
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:23,700
(Hello?)

221
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:25,210
Go ahead, Mr President.

222
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:26,270
This is on?

223
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,720
I don't get good reception in my office.

224
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,190
Ah, agents Z and D.

225
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,120
I'd like to congratulate you on the
successful mission,

226
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:40,021
and in capturing that really
really bad guy...

227
00:39:40,021 --> 00:39:42,581
... Who's that dude's named, Dick?

228
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:46,571
...and in capturing that really
really bad guy Hussein.

229
00:39:47,531 --> 00:39:50,251
I also want to thank you on
behalf of the American public,

230
00:39:50,251 --> 00:39:53,701
because they would have been very
sad to have been blown up.

231
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,470
It was our pleasure, sir.

232
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,850
As a personal gesture,

233
00:39:58,850 --> 00:40:02,850
I would like to grant you to
the use of my really big boat.

234
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:04,850
And it's a fancy one too,

235
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:07,240
to celebrate your anniversary.

236
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,440
Oh my God!

237
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,540
Thank you Mr President. Sir.

238
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,600
Look at that, Dick,

239
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,040
now that's what I call a missile.

240
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,770
[*flsuhing the toilets*]

241
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:21,640
[*fart*]

242
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,010
Oh my God, do you believe it?

243
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,690
I'm going on a cruise...

244
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:30,750
... on the president's boat!

245
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:32,490
Oh my God.

246
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,380
This is so awesome!
Oh my God!

247
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,260
I never get to go anywhere...

248
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,450
[*indistinct chat*]

249
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,720
- What?
- Who are they?

250
00:40:57,650 --> 00:40:58,860
Well, since you're an agent now,

251
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:00,600
X is auditioning new assistants.

252
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:04,840
He's replacing me?

253
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,850
Uh, pff..

254
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:11,270
This is a top secret mission,

255
00:41:11,450 --> 00:41:13,720
of the utmost importance.

256
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,780
I need for you to take this phone,

257
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:20,200
and answer it whenever I call.

258
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:24,040
If you don't I could be killed.

259
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,730
Do you understand?

260
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,610
He's replacing me.

261
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:52,500
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

262
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:00,660
Okay, okay, okay.

263
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:03,740
Do you understand?

264
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,751
- Understand what?
- [*she laughs*]

265
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:09,270
What was the question again?

266
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,050
(Okay)

267
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:13,600
You're perfect.

268
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:15,530
You're hired.

269
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,700
- Me?
- Me? No, me!

270
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:18,740
No, me!

271
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:20,300
He's talking about me, okay?

272
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:20,950
- Me!
- Me!

273
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:21,660
Hep Hep!

274
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:23,030
Okay, both of you.

275
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:24,530
You're both hired.

276
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:32,561
Stop it.

277
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:33,640
Stop it!

278
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:44,870
[*indistinct chat*]

279
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:54,350
So...

280
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:57,940
You guys are Agent X new
administrative assistants, huh?

281
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:00,850
No, silly, we're secretaries!

282
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:06,610
Unbelievable.

283
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,981
***?
It could have happened to anyone.

284
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,150
But it didn't happen to anyone.

285
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:30,570
It happened to me.

286
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:33,740
I must have keep *** like that.

287
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:45,860
Sir Jacks.

288
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:48,910
Sir Jacks, at your service.

289
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:53,520
Look on the bright side,

290
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:56,370
it's not every day you get into
the Queen's knickers, no? Is it?

291
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,010
Actually she wasn't wearing any, was she?

292
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,080
Come on Tea Biscuit,

293
00:44:03,730 --> 00:44:05,560
let's go slay some dragons.

294
00:44:15,610 --> 00:44:18,930
[*Mission Impossible theme*]

295
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:21,760
(Agent Jacks, agent Watson,)

296
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,730
(do you read? This is agent Q, please respond.)

297
00:44:34,711 --> 00:44:35,761
This is Watson.

298
00:44:35,791 --> 00:44:38,781
(We ave just received a coded transmission)

299
00:44:38,781 --> 00:44:40,781
(Seems that North Korean leader Jong-Il has ***)

300
00:44:40,781 --> 00:44:43,511
(large quantites of unknown substance,)

301
00:44:43,511 --> 00:44:44,681
(for use in a weapon.)

302
00:44:45,372 --> 00:44:46,782
***

303
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,250
(We are not sure.)

304
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:50,900
(But the message allude to an
impending large-scale attack.)

305
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:53,350
(We attract a vessel transport
one of the ships)

306
00:44:53,350 --> 00:44:54,500
(***)

307
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:57,070
(Proceed immediately to *** air force base.)

308
00:44:57,410 --> 00:44:59,090
(your transport is already in route and)

309
00:44:59,090 --> 00:45:00,860
(intelligence waiting to further review)

310
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:02,290
(with ***)

311
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:06,440
(This message will self-destruct in... 5...)

312
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:09,700
(4... 3... 2...)

313
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:11,520
(1...) [*BANG*]

314
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:26,010
I hate when they do that.

315
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:29,110
That's the fourth one this week.

316
00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:31,260
And I wanted some toast tonight.

317
00:45:38,350 --> 00:45:39,900
Now, the mirror on the wall,

318
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:42,020
who's the sexiest of them all?

319
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:01,880
[*beep*]

320
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:04,940
Many pardons, Supreme Commander Sir,

321
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:06,940
the *** is here to see you.

322
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:11,330
Oh... have a wait in my office.

323
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:19,010
I'm so sexy.

324
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:21,890
She not resist me this time.

325
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:28,960
Ah...

326
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:32,600
Jung-Ho... What a pleasure.

327
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:39,520
Sorry for the interruption, Commander,

328
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:42,670
I was sent to informing that
Dr Kwan has arrived safely,

329
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:44,760
and is now working on your formula.

330
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,900
He's guaranteed me he'll
have results shortly.

331
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:49,280
Excellent.

332
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:53,100
Wacky americans keep searching
for nuclear weapons.

333
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,300
They will never suspect this.

334
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:58,100
I so smart!
I genius!

335
00:46:58,470 --> 00:46:59,390
Genius!

336
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:04,100
Tell Dr Kwan he has exactly 24 hours.

337
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,900
General So-Hung will be joining you to
oversee completion of the attack.

338
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:12,320
Oh, Yung-Ho?

339
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:14,810
Shall we make with the sex?

340
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:19,600
Yung-Ho?

341
00:47:19,850 --> 00:47:22,170
Oh... You play hard-to-get?
Alrighty!

342
00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:23,470
I've been stretching.

343
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:24,570
[*ouch*]

344
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:26,180
Yung-Ho?

345
00:47:26,911 --> 00:47:27,901
Yung-Ho?

346
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:47,210
From now on...

347
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,600
...you're gonna be known as agents...

348
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:52,890
... "T"...

349
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:56,530
... and "A".

350
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
You know it is a terrible thing, though,

351
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:07,410
to think that you may not come
back from one of these missions.

352
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:09,250
[*ooooh*]

353
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:13,300
I'm sorry...

354
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:15,960
I'm okay though.

355
00:48:17,350 --> 00:48:20,120
'Cause it's just something
that I, CIA agents,

356
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:21,811
have to put up with, you know.

357
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:24,810
Wear it like a badge of honor

358
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,640
Still the... thought of never...

359
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:32,350
...have a look or touch you again...

360
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:36,850
I'm alright...

361
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:41,700
(No no, we can like that, eternally...)

362
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:42,730
No...

363
00:48:46,650 --> 00:48:50,371
(No... we can...)

364
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:08,870
Ouch, hold it!

365
00:49:10,830 --> 00:49:12,090
Okay, okay...

366
00:49:15,050 --> 00:49:17,360
Ladies, there is enough of agent X...

367

00:49:19,810 --> 00:49:21,150

369
00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:23,230
...and... listen...

00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:24,750
if you're gonna be a team...

371
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:27,800
We're gonna see how you...

372
00:49:28,610 --> 00:49:30,610
You know... work to...

379
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:42,900
The supreme commander will not be
pleased with another failure.

380
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:44,380
I'm close.

381
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:45,530
I'm close.

382
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:46,870
I just need more time.

383
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:50,180
You are almost out of time, doctor.

enough to store weapons.

how the doctors

to just poison themselves.

In a jungle,

523
01:32:29,379 --> 01:32:31,659
one can survive if we have food,

524
01:32:31,659 --> 01:32:33,809
if we have some water.

525
01:32:35,159 --> 01:32:36,099

01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:45,871
George's is so not funny.

553
01:35:54,500 --> 01:35:55,730
George?

554
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,469
[*explosion*]

555
01:36:14,500 --> 01:36:15,159
Oh!

556
01:36:16,989 --> 01:36:19,399
Oh, that's my favourite...
[*machinegun shots*]

557
01:36:21,019 --> 01:36:22,229
[*gunshots*]

558
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:35,760
[*hmmm!*]

559
01:36:47,260 --> 01:36:54,909
Jax Rachel what what are you doing here

560
01:36:47,900 --> 01:36:49,360
- Jacks?
- Rachel?

561
01:36:49,400 --> 01:36:51,620
- Watson?
- What are you doing here?

562
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:54,000
Are you on the mission?

563
01:36:55,700 --> 01:36:56,339
Yeah...

564
01:36:57,450 --> 01:36:58,550
[whispering:] What mission?

565
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:01,050
I don't know, he doesn't tell me anything.

566
01:37:01,350 --> 01:37:02,120
Oh...

567
01:37:02,300 --> 01:37:04,250
Okay, I think it's clear.

568
01:37:04,250 --> 01:37:05,730
Let's move. Quick. Let's move.

569
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:18,360
You, uh, do likely be needing these.

570
01:37:18,820 --> 01:37:19,640
Thanks.

571
01:37:21,850 --> 01:37:22,620
So...

572
01:37:23,300 --> 01:37:25,450
You're really Sir Jacks now, huh?

573
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:27,480
I can't believe you guys got knighted.

574
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:28,920
Oh... hum...

575
01:37:29,200 --> 01:37:31,001
Well, one of us did,

576
01:37:31,001 --> 01:37:33,180
but things didn't go quite
as planned for Watson.

577
01:37:35,300 --> 01:37:36,100
Really?

578
01:37:36,830 --> 01:37:37,760
What happened?

579
01:37:39,900 --> 01:37:41,420
I don't want to talk about it, okay?

580
01:37:41,420 --> 01:37:43,860
Sir *** keep rubbing it in my face.

581
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:45,170
(Don't be so sensitive, man)

582
01:37:45,500 --> 01:37:47,380
Let's just brief Rachel now, would you?

583
01:37:52,700 --> 01:37:54,520
Well, as you know, this
island is the smallest

584
01:37:54,520 --> 01:37:56,810
of the group belonging to
North Korean leader, Jong-Il.

585
01:37:58,000 --> 01:37:59,521
Now a British intel has informed us

586
01:37:59,521 --> 01:38:02,681
that he has hidden some sort of
weapon here in preparing for attack.

587
01:38:04,450 --> 01:38:06,560
We've been using satelite imagery

588
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:10,530
to scan the terrain for any
photographic element of anything

589
01:38:10,530 --> 01:38:13,860
man-made existing out here.

590
01:38:15,950 --> 01:38:20,930
So we began searching the island on
for 2 days ago, thinking perhaps

591
01:38:20,930 --> 01:38:24,640
Jong-Il had stashed the weapons in a cave.

592
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:27,150
But so far, we've had no luck.

593
01:38:27,250 --> 01:38:27,920
Hmmm.

594
01:38:29,350 --> 01:38:32,190
Have you guys consider the
possibility that maybe it's underground?

595
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:35,950
- No...
- [*Jacks toughs*]

596
01:38:35,950 --> 01:38:37,990
Um, I mean, yes.

597
01:38:45,550 --> 01:38:46,450
Here.

598
01:38:46,650 --> 01:38:50,280
I'll hack into one of the
US heat-seeking satellite,

599
01:38:50,280 --> 01:38:52,680
reposition it to scan this island,

600
01:38:52,680 --> 01:38:54,210
see what we can find.

601
01:39:06,200 --> 01:39:06,800
Wow...

602
01:39:08,100 --> 01:39:09,490
You really did the..

603
01:39:09,490 --> 01:39:11,949
on your top secret clearance now, didn't you?

604
01:39:14,100 --> 01:39:15,500
Could you doubt me, sir Jacks?

605
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:18,980
Never again, my dear.
Never again.

606
01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:23,500
Look, it's working...

607
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:25,290
Goog god.

608
01:39:26,100 --> 01:39:27,810
It's been been right
beneath us the whole time.

609
01:39:28,600 --> 01:39:32,289
It appears to be about a *** of us.

610
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:37,131
- Oh my god.
- What?

611
01:39:37,131 --> 01:39:38,511
We have to tell George.

612
01:39:39,150 --> 01:39:40,000
George?

613
01:39:40,650 --> 01:39:42,840
George, yes! Where is he, old chap?

614
01:39:50,100 --> 01:39:51,990
Oh, nice!

615
01:39:52,500 --> 01:39:54,960
Very nice. Look at these statues.

616
01:39:57,950 --> 01:39:59,010
Very nice.

617
01:39:59,810 --> 01:40:01,120
Wonderful place.

618
01:40:03,259 --> 01:40:05,739
Ouch, ah. Oh that was painful.

619
01:40:05,569 --> 01:40:06,739
Oh, thank you.

620
01:40:07,200 --> 01:40:09,420
Thank you very much, but
I could have walked.

621
01:40:09,420 --> 01:40:10,810
There was a woo...

622
01:40:22,500 --> 01:40:23,700
Ouh!

623
01:40:30,750 --> 01:40:32,350
Oh, hey, woo... Time out!

624
01:40:32,350 --> 01:40:33,950
Time out. Hold on. Time out.

625
01:40:33,950 --> 01:40:36,440
Time out. Woo, secret wedding ring.

626
01:40:36,651 --> 01:40:38,811
I know it's means something
to some people but

627
01:40:38,811 --> 01:40:39,901
to other people it means nothing,

628
01:40:39,901 --> 01:40:42,571
but to me I love Rachel.

629
01:40:42,591 --> 01:40:44,212
Whoa. Rachel? Rachel?

630
01:40:44,212 --> 01:40:45,873
Loving Rachel. Loving Rachel. Whoa.

631
01:40:45,873 --> 01:40:47,163
Something else is up beside Rachel.

632
01:40:47,163 --> 01:40:48,293
Hello?

633
01:40:49,700 --> 01:40:52,740
Okay, wow, let's skip it...

634
01:40:53,100 --> 01:40:54,080
Stop it.

635
01:40:54,080 --> 01:40:55,640
Stop it, I'm getting wood.

636
01:40:56,850 --> 01:40:57,790
Woah, getting wood...

637
01:40:59,450 --> 01:41:01,820
Okay, okay. Just a little bit.

638
01:41:02,750 --> 01:41:04,390
All right, just a little bit.

639
01:41:06,650 --> 01:41:07,800
Okay, okay, okay,

640
01:41:08,100 --> 01:41:10,109
all right? I wouldn't want to be rude.

641
01:50:41,870 --> 01:50:44,990
One of the security details found
an intruder on the beach.

642
01:50:45,580 --> 01:50:47,750
Oh, would they eliminated?

643
01:50:48,250 --> 01:50:49,591
She escaped.

644
01:50:51,050 --> 01:50:52,760
Son of bitch. Shit.

645
01:50:54,800 --> 01:50:56,340
Have my men ***

646
01:51:56,580 --> 01:51:57,860
[*roar*]

647
01:51:57,900 --> 01:51:59,280
- What is that?
- What is that?

648
01:52:01,200 --> 01:52:02,240
George?

649
01:52:15,100 --> 01:52:15,890
[*roar*]

650
01:52:18,150 --> 01:52:20,340
Don't... move.

651
01:52:22,900 --> 01:52:25,080
Slowly guys. Slowly.

652
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:29,281
- [*roar*]
- Move!

653
01:52:33,100 --> 01:52:35,000
Sir Jacks!
Shoot that!

654
01:52:49,300 --> 01:52:50,610
Rachel I'm coming.

655
01:53:00,350 --> 01:53:01,490
Oh my god.

656
01:53:02,100 --> 01:53:03,260
Rachel?

657
01:53:06,610 --> 01:53:07,450
What the...?

658
01:53:07,450 --> 01:53:10,170
Agent Jacks? Meet my new friend.

659
01:53:15,350 --> 01:53:16,961
Rachel, how?

660
01:53:18,400 --> 01:53:21,660
Top secret pheromone spray.
Formula 69.

661
01:53:22,150 --> 01:53:23,740
Females find it irresistible.

662
01:53:25,200 --> 01:53:27,710
Obviously the species is not a factor.

663
01:53:27,820 --> 01:53:28,710
I'd say.

664
01:53:28,710 --> 01:53:29,879
- Can I have it?
- No.

665
01:53:30,570 --> 01:53:32,711
Oh... Why?

666
01:53:47,200 --> 01:53:48,600
- Sir?
- What are you doing?

667
01:53:49,400 --> 01:53:51,070
It's no time for siesta Watson.
Come on get up!

668
01:53:51,070 --> 01:53:52,150
(What happened?)

669
01:53:52,730 --> 01:53:54,280
You fainted. That's what happened.

670
01:53:54,600 --> 01:53:55,270
Fainted?

671
01:53:55,270 --> 01:53:57,500
Yes, I told you once,
now I told you twice.

672
01:53:57,500 --> 01:53:58,940
That's one crafty bird.

673
01:53:59,400 --> 01:54:00,050
Come on!

674
01:54:00,770 --> 01:54:01,980
Quickly...

675
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:06,830
That's one crafty bird, Watson.

676
01:54:16,700 --> 01:54:18,000
I don't get it...

677
01:54:18,300 --> 01:54:19,470
Where could he be?

678
01:54:19,720 --> 01:54:21,100
He could be anywhere.

679
01:54:21,100 --> 01:54:23,050
It's George.
He couldn't have gone that far.

680
01:54:23,309 --> 01:54:25,569
- Who knows?
- Have you see the shape he's in?

681
01:54:30,300 --> 01:54:31,220
***

682
01:54:31,600 --> 01:54:32,430
Look!

683
01:54:32,801 --> 01:54:35,571
This is his floaty.
He couldn't have gone far.

684
01:54:36,100 --> 01:54:38,980
- Sir?
- You thought what I think it is?

685
01:54:41,800 --> 01:54:43,041
Cannibals.

686
01:54:43,041 --> 01:54:44,310
Cannibals?

687
01:54:44,650 --> 01:54:46,000
There's cannibals here?

688
01:54:47,900 --> 01:54:49,070
What does that mean for George?

689
01:54:52,250 --> 01:54:53,270
What...

690
01:54:53,650 --> 01:54:54,800
- Sorry...
- What does that mean?

691
01:54:54,800 --> 01:54:55,989
- I'm sorry Rachel.
- Sorry Rachel.

692
01:54:55,989 --> 01:54:56,809
No...

693
01:54:56,809 --> 01:54:58,239
George!

694
01:55:01,900 --> 01:55:02,800
He's...

695
01:55:02,800 --> 01:55:04,630
He doesn't hurt ***. Come on.

696
01:55:04,900 --> 01:55:06,850
Why there's someone who wanna eat George?

697
01:55:09,300 --> 01:55:11,780
Number one: buy new platform shoes.

698
01:55:13,550 --> 01:55:14,260
Check.

699
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,580
Number two: update my my-appraised(?) page.
Yeah, check.

700
01:55:19,340 --> 01:55:21,720
Number three: blew something up.

701
01:55:21,950 --> 01:55:23,240
[*explosion*]

702
01:55:23,900 --> 01:55:24,980
He-he. Check.

703
01:55:26,400 --> 01:55:29,250
Number four: father more illegitimate children...

704
01:55:34,150 --> 01:55:35,630
About to be checked...

705
01:55:37,600 --> 01:55:40,160
Yung-Ho. I need you consider my offer.

706
01:55:40,300 --> 01:55:42,340
We can make beautiful evil offspring together.

707
01:55:42,910 --> 01:55:45,860
Intruders were discovered
in the island, Commander.

708
01:55:46,460 --> 01:55:49,100
Would don't just stand there, looking cute,
with your dragon face in your big cans.

709
01:55:49,100 --> 01:55:50,600
Go get them and destroy them.

710
01:55:54,250 --> 01:55:55,080
Oh wait...

711
01:55:55,950 --> 01:55:58,400
Tell me s sexy thing.

712
01:56:14,700 --> 01:56:17,720
Rachel, I'm sure he knew how
you really felt.

713
01:56:20,900 --> 01:56:22,560
That's what I'm afraid of...

714
01:56:23,700 --> 01:56:24,510
You see,

715
01:56:24,800 --> 01:56:26,300
the last time I saw George,

716
01:56:27,150 --> 01:56:29,230
I hit him with my shoe...

717
01:56:41,300 --> 01:56:42,210
To George.

718
01:56:42,600 --> 01:56:44,190
A gentleman spy.

719
01:56:49,200 --> 01:56:50,709
And a great soldier.

720
01:56:51,500 --> 01:56:53,460
Well... sort of.

721
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:55,960
Rachel,

722
01:56:56,400 --> 01:56:58,671
many comrades fall in ***

723
01:56:59,450 --> 01:57:00,910
It is the nature of our business.

724
01:57:01,500 --> 01:57:03,890
But George died saving his country.

725
01:57:04,700 --> 01:57:06,000
You should be very proud.

726
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:09,470
Hmm, you're cute.

727
01:57:10,150 --> 01:57:13,050
You sound like that little
insurance lizard on the TV.

728
01:57:13,100 --> 01:57:13,670
Huh?

729
01:57:13,670 --> 01:57:15,239
- We should make out.
- What?

730
02:08:41,500 --> 02:08:43,860
Oh, I do love a natural woman.

731
02:08:47,250 --> 02:08:48,430
Nazi tiger...

732
02:08:51,150 --> 02:08:53,040
What you... What are you doing?

733
02:08:54,500 --> 02:08:55,850
What the fuck are you doing?

734
02:08:55,900 --> 02:08:57,100
You touching my leg!

735
02:08:57,680 --> 02:08:59,091
P-Put your leg there.

736
02:08:59,091 --> 02:09:00,921
Wh... What about you, sir?

737
02:09:01,150 --> 02:09:01,900
What?

738
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,330
- Sir! Don't... Don't move!
(- What are you...?)

739
02:09:04,330 --> 02:09:05,000
(What is it?)

740
02:09:04,881 --> 02:09:06,811
What is it? What is it?

741
02:09:08,200 --> 02:09:09,100
Is it yours?

742
02:09:08,999 --> 02:09:09,771
No.

743
02:09:09,899 --> 02:09:11,859
Don't *** it over here, you freak.

744
02:09:49,100 --> 02:09:49,970
Guys...

745
02:09:50,250 --> 02:09:51,770
I think somebody's out there.

746
02:09:51,770 --> 02:09:52,980
How do know?

747
02:09:53,900 --> 02:09:55,280
I don't know... I just...

748
02:09:55,700 --> 02:09:57,140
I don't know, I can sense it.

749
02:09:57,700 --> 02:09:59,360
- Oh, you can sense it, can you?
- Hmm-mm

750
02:09:59,600 --> 02:10:01,110
I think my highly-trained instinct

751
02:10:01,110 --> 02:10:03,050
would have alerted me to
anything is going on out there.

752
02:10:04,450 --> 02:10:06,160
I think she my be right, sir.

753
02:10:06,490 --> 02:10:07,750
How'd you know that?

754
02:10:07,750 --> 02:10:09,240
Oh shit! Get out!

755
02:10:09,240 --> 02:10:12,240
[*gunshots*]

756
02:12:13,050 --> 02:12:15,310
Look, I got the big gun now.

757
02:12:25,600 --> 02:12:26,520
Sorry...

758
02:12:31,300 --> 02:12:32,420
I'll be over here.

759
02:12:49,800 --> 02:12:50,940
Good job, Watson!

760
02:12:51,450 --> 02:12:52,210
Yes sir.

761
02:12:53,600 --> 02:12:54,801
Thank you sir.

762
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,100
I'll be over here, sir.

763
02:13:08,020 --> 02:13:09,100
(Everything is alright now?)

764
02:13:09,200 --> 02:13:11,510
We better git it ready.
There could be more coming.

765
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:12,630
Come on.

766
02:13:15,700 --> 02:13:16,550
Wait wait wait.

767
02:13:17,300 --> 02:13:18,340
What's that sound?

768
02:13:24,600 --> 02:13:25,510
Cannibals.

769
02:13:26,800 --> 02:13:28,600
It's the sound of the sacrificial drums.

770
02:13:29,550 --> 02:13:30,869
Sacrifice... oh!

771
02:13:31,150 --> 02:13:33,779
You don't think... George?

772
02:13:34,779 --> 02:13:36,079
Could it be?

773
02:13:41,829 --> 02:13:44,829
[*tribal song*]

774
02:14:10,500 --> 02:14:11,460
What a minute...

775
02:14:12,300 --> 02:14:13,580
That's not George.

776
02:14:14,850 --> 02:14:16,750
Looks like that porno chap.

777
02:14:17,700 --> 02:14:19,820
Yes, it does.

778
02:14:20,200 --> 02:14:21,400
What's his name?

779
02:14:21,850 --> 02:14:23,610
Evan Stone, sir.

780
02:14:24,750 --> 02:14:25,830
Well...

781
02:14:26,090 --> 02:14:28,200
That might look like Evan Stone,

782
02:14:28,200 --> 02:14:30,431
but that's my George.

783
02:14:30,590 --> 02:14:32,430
New and improved.

784
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:34,880
And all the right spots on ***.

785
02:14:36,800 --> 02:14:38,190
How are we gonna save him?

786
02:14:38,710 --> 02:14:41,710
Hmm...

787
02:14:40,550 --> 02:14:42,910
Well, sir Jacks,

788
02:14:43,670 --> 02:14:46,200
what's your great instincts tell you now?

789
02:14:49,200 --> 02:14:51,500
We're gonna need a distraction.

790
02:14:52,300 --> 02:14:53,860
What kind of distraction?

791
02:14:53,860 --> 02:14:55,310
There's so many of them...

792
02:15:01,600 --> 02:15:03,440
I think I have just the thing.

793
02:15:06,250 --> 02:15:10,240
[*they quietly laughs*]

794
02:15:23,300 --> 02:15:24,310
[*pssssst*]

795
02:15:29,050 --> 02:15:29,550
Ah!

796
02:15:30,970 --> 02:15:33,480
Rachel, what are you doing here?

797
02:15:33,700 --> 02:15:35,310
I'm rescuing you.

798
02:15:35,450 --> 02:15:36,870
Now come on, let's go.

799
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:39,500
Rescue... I don't need your rescue.

800
02:15:39,500 --> 02:15:40,801
Not from someone like you.

801
02:15:41,320 --> 02:15:44,001
These. These are my people and they,

802
02:15:44,001 --> 02:15:47,750
they love me, unlike you.

803
02:15:48,950 --> 02:15:50,301
Right...

804
02:15:50,981 --> 02:15:52,061
Well,

805
02:15:52,061 --> 02:15:53,951
your people,

806
02:15:53,951 --> 02:15:56,231
are going to eat you.

807
02:15:56,450 --> 02:15:58,760
Yeah, somebody is jealous.

808
02:16:04,600 --> 02:16:06,590
No, you jackass.

809
02:16:06,850 --> 02:16:08,360
Look around.

810
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:10,370
They're going to eat you.

811
02:16:11,021 --> 02:16:12,791
They're cannibals.

812
02:16:12,791 --> 02:16:14,911
Yeah... they're going to eat me... hehe.

813
02:16:27,100 --> 02:16:28,170
Cannibals.

814
02:16:36,500 --> 02:16:37,180
Ah!

815
02:16:40,600 --> 02:16:41,660
Be quiet.

816
02:16:46,940 --> 02:16:56,630
ladies oh come on what he's good enough

817
02:16:47,200 --> 02:16:50,580
- Ladies!
- Ahhh!!!

818
02:16:51,700 --> 02:16:53,240
Oh come on!

819
02:16:53,240 --> 02:16:55,340
What? He's good enough
to eat and I'm not?

820
02:16:55,510 --> 02:16:57,200
What a bloody hell with you?

821
02:17:10,950 --> 02:17:12,820
I think we should get out
of here before they come back.

822
02:17:12,820 --> 02:17:14,060
Yes, good idea.

823
02:17:14,500 --> 02:17:16,050
Oh, George, have you heard?

824
02:17:16,780 --> 02:17:18,090
I'm sir Jacks now.

825
02:17:22,150 --> 02:17:24,100
Hey! Does anybody see Watson?

826
02:17:26,800 --> 02:17:29,680
Okay, I think we should split up.

827
02:17:30,200 --> 02:17:32,570
Watson and I will head to the
mainland and take out Jong-Il.

828
02:17:33,100 --> 02:17:36,270
Rachel, George, you stay here
look for the underground bunker.

829
02:17:36,500 --> 02:17:38,870
From the satellite images,
*** is beneath us.

830
02:17:39,300 --> 02:17:41,050
Entrance has to be around here somewhere.

831
02:17:41,500 --> 02:17:42,900
Now buddies, ***

832
02:17:45,250 --> 02:17:46,420
To meet again.

833
02:17:49,350 --> 02:17:52,250
- You are fantastic.
- Thanks.

834
02:17:56,330 --> 02:17:57,628
What the hell did he mean by that?

835
02:17:58,900 --> 02:17:59,700
What?

836
02:17:59,800 --> 02:18:01,720
I mean: what the hell did he
mean by that?

837
02:18:01,720 --> 02:18:02,850
"You are fantastic."

838
02:18:04,850 --> 02:18:06,140
Don't start with me George.

839
02:18:06,700 --> 02:18:09,550
I know what the cannibals do to people
before they eat them.

840
02:18:10,400 --> 02:18:11,300
That's right.

841
02:18:11,950 --> 02:18:13,610
I watch the Discovery Channel.

842
02:18:16,550 --> 02:18:18,640
"I know what cannibal do before they eat."

843
02:18:19,050 --> 02:18:21,330
Don't worry: I watch the Discovery Channel.

844
02:18:21,450 --> 02:18:23,440
(George? Now!)

845
02:18:29,500 --> 02:18:30,650
I don't get it.

846
02:18:32,100 --> 02:18:34,730
Jacks said the hatch is here.
Can't find it.

847
02:18:35,400 --> 02:18:36,600
Are you looking in the right place?

848
02:18:36,600 --> 02:18:39,600
I don't think Jacks knows always
what Jacks is talking about.

849
02:18:41,700 --> 02:18:42,810
Oh really?

850
02:18:43,350 --> 02:18:44,640
And you do?

851
02:18:44,640 --> 02:18:46,101
Let me get this straight:

852
02:18:46,300 --> 02:18:49,550
You, who sank the President's yacht,

853
02:18:49,800 --> 02:18:51,780
got us stranded on an island,

854
02:18:50,450 --> 02:18:55,820
stranded on an island almost got

855
02:18:52,050 --> 02:18:54,731
almost got yourself eaten by cannibals.

856
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:55,930
Wow.

857
02:18:55,930 --> 02:18:57,979
Why would I think you know how to find it?

858
02:18:59,700 --> 02:19:01,100
Oh my god, honey!

859
02:19:01,100 --> 02:19:02,530
You found it!

860
02:19:04,300 --> 02:19:06,310
- I found what?
- The hatch!

861
02:19:06,450 --> 02:19:08,380
Oh yeah! I found the hatch.

862
02:19:09,150 --> 02:19:12,641
You dipshit.

863
02:19:11,100 --> 02:19:12,459
- Look!
- What? Ahhh!!!

864
02:19:14,300 --> 02:19:15,770
Oh, the hatch!

865
02:19:17,650 --> 02:19:18,611
Open it.

866
02:19:18,850 --> 02:19:20,720
Yeah, all right.

867
02:19:21,250 --> 02:19:24,460
Not like that!
Try the handle.

868
02:19:48,500 --> 02:19:49,520
(A little help here?)

869
02:19:54,400 --> 02:19:55,530
After you, sir.

870
02:19:59,200 --> 02:20:00,220
Down there?

871
02:20:00,480 --> 02:20:02,100
- Down there.
- Down there?

872
02:20:02,150 --> 02:20:03,180
Down there.

873
02:20:05,400 --> 02:20:07,250
- Down there...
- Down there.

874
02:20:47,650 --> 02:20:48,600
What?

875
02:20:49,800 --> 02:20:50,899
Watch it:

876
02:20:51,050 --> 02:20:52,650
Just if we don't make it out,

877
02:20:52,650 --> 02:20:55,550
I want to tell you I'm
sorry I said I hated you.

878
02:20:55,900 --> 02:20:57,281
I don't hate you.

879
02:20:59,841 --> 02:21:02,141
I'm sorry too,
I'm sorry about everything,

880
02:21:02,141 --> 02:21:04,601
I'm sorry about... ruining our anniversary,

881
02:21:04,601 --> 02:21:05,871
I'm sorry.

882
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,230
You didn't write that. And hey,

883
02:21:08,230 --> 02:21:10,570
this is memorable, right?

884
02:21:11,100 --> 02:21:12,320
Right.

885
02:21:13,621 --> 02:21:16,621
I think I see something up ahead.

886
02:21:46,750 --> 02:21:47,921
What are you doing?

887
02:21:48,450 --> 02:21:49,820
I'm gonna call headquarters.

888
02:21:49,820 --> 02:21:51,580
They have no idea where we are...

889
02:21:51,730 --> 02:21:53,460
...or what's going on.

890
02:21:56,150 --> 02:21:58,170
- What's wrong?
- It's weird...

891
02:21:58,900 --> 02:22:00,090
...no response.

892
02:32:13,500 --> 02:32:15,990
Oh shit, the CSV has call for distress,

893
02:32:15,990 --> 02:32:16,990
localise-it!

894
02:32:20,550 --> 02:32:21,950
What is all this stuff anyway?

895
02:32:22,550 --> 02:32:23,790
Barbecue sauce.

896
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:27,210
That's kind of weird.

897
02:32:30,550 --> 02:32:31,580
George get down!

898
02:32:39,930 --> 02:32:45,420
vast of a poison has been mixing to the

899
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:42,919
The *** of a poison
has been mixed into the sauce.

900
02:32:43,800 --> 02:32:47,350
All the bottles are packaged,
ready to be shipped.

901
02:32:45,420 --> 02:32:50,369
ready to be shipped the supreme

902
02:32:48,500 --> 02:32:52,250
(The Supreme Commander shall reward
you for your dedication to the cause.)

903
02:32:52,550 --> 02:32:54,260
By this time tomorrow,

904
02:32:54,260 --> 02:32:59,150
these bottles will be on their way
to every American grocery store.

905
02:32:59,150 --> 02:33:01,450
[Laughter]

906
02:33:02,750 --> 02:33:04,580
Not if I can help it!

907
02:33:06,300 --> 02:33:08,409
Ah! I can *** it for you.

908
02:33:10,800 --> 02:33:11,820
Go ahead.

909
02:33:14,600 --> 02:33:16,520
Make my day.

910
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:25,840
Have you just disarmed me and
hit me the nose at the same time?

911
02:33:25,850 --> 02:33:26,640
All right...

912
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:29,660
See what you got, how quick you are, uh.

913
02:33:41,100 --> 02:33:44,780
Not bad at all.
Now I have to know ***

914
02:33:55,550 --> 02:33:58,010
Now I've seen your Shaolin, ***

915
02:33:58,010 --> 02:33:59,050
Join in.

916
02:33:59,050 --> 02:34:01,601
Let's see how you do
with a flying grasshopper.

917
02:34:14,800 --> 02:34:16,050
Alright Mr Master.

918
02:34:16,200 --> 02:34:18,131
Let's see how well you do
with the broken back.

919
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:29,790
Son of a bitch.

920
02:35:03,900 --> 02:35:05,520
Have a little sauce!

921
02:35:07,400 --> 02:35:08,729
A box of sauce!

922
02:35:11,350 --> 02:35:12,890
That, a big helmet!

923
02:35:14,100 --> 02:35:16,549
That, a machine gun!

924
02:35:17,900 --> 02:35:19,130
Crap!

925
02:35:39,800 --> 02:35:42,570
George,

926
02:35:41,171 --> 02:35:42,580
what are you doing?

927
02:35:45,150 --> 02:35:47,660
I just killed the most deadly
midnight assassin ninja,

928
02:35:47,660 --> 02:35:49,510
Shaolin master the world has ever known.

929
02:35:49,510 --> 02:35:50,730
He's right over there.

930
02:35:53,400 --> 02:35:54,880
You don't have to lie.

931
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:57,569
(I quit fucking around, let's go.)

932
02:35:58,471 --> 02:36:00,581
[*George imitates Rachel speaking*]

933
02:36:04,500 --> 02:36:05,970
Let's go!!

934
02:36:05,970 --> 02:36:07,560
On the chopper!

935
02:36:07,700 --> 02:36:10,590
Let's go!
Let's go men!

936
02:36:11,590 --> 02:36:12,860
And women!

937
02:36:16,700 --> 02:36:18,200
Excuse me, Mr President,

938
02:36:18,200 --> 02:36:21,200
there's very important call
for you on line 1.

939
02:36:21,400 --> 02:36:24,400
I told you I'm doing important
president's stuff and

940
02:36:24,400 --> 02:36:26,270
I don't want to be disturbed.

941
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:28,850
Tell that dick to take a message.

942
02:36:29,450 --> 02:36:30,210
Okay.

943
02:36:30,210 --> 02:36:31,590
Will there be anything else?

944
02:36:32,900 --> 02:36:34,270
Come in.

945
02:36:36,850 --> 02:36:38,150
Yes?

946
02:36:38,300 --> 02:36:41,790
What's the capital of Florida?

947
02:36:40,900 --> 02:36:43,560
Uh-huh... It's Tallahassee, but...

948
02:36:43,560 --> 02:36:45,890
...that's Texas, sir.

949
02:36:46,600 --> 02:36:47,630
That's Texas?

950
02:36:47,630 --> 02:36:50,300
Yeah, you know, your home state.

951
02:36:51,500 --> 02:36:52,400
Yeah, yeah.

952
02:36:54,300 --> 02:36:55,150
T...

953
02:36:56,550 --> 02:36:57,440
E...

954
02:36:58,200 --> 02:36:59,100
X...

955
02:36:59,650 --> 02:37:00,410
- H...
- A.

956
02:37:01,090 --> 02:37:02,580
"S", yes.

957
02:37:02,580 --> 02:37:04,060
Thanks. Clean. Go.

958
02:37:47,100 --> 02:37:47,710
Damn.

959
02:37:48,230 --> 02:37:50,100
Got to figure out a way around ***,

960
02:37:50,100 --> 02:37:51,830
*** bloody entire army.

961
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:54,729
I have an idea.

962
02:37:55,250 --> 02:37:55,960
You do?

963
02:37:56,960 --> 02:37:57,860
Hmm-hmm.

964
02:37:58,700 --> 02:38:00,020
- What?
- Take out, sir.

965
02:38:00,020 --> 02:38:01,160
Take out? Take out...

966
02:38:01,600 --> 02:38:03,620
Good idea! I'm bloody stop... Take out?!

967
02:38:03,620 --> 02:38:05,310
Ain't talking about take out!

968
02:38:05,310 --> 02:38:07,510
I can't be thinking about our
stomachs in this kind of time.

969
02:38:08,510 --> 02:38:10,170
Hello, do you speak english?

970
02:38:19,100 --> 02:38:21,370
Oh shit, are you serious?

971
02:38:30,850 --> 02:38:32,180
- Wow...
- Eeew...

972
02:38:36,050 --> 02:38:38,390
Is this... blood? Blood!

973
02:38:39,300 --> 02:38:41,740
No, idiot, it's barbecue sauce.

974
02:38:42,600 --> 02:38:43,420
Eeeew...

975
02:38:46,100 --> 02:38:47,639
(God! Damn it Wilma!)

976
02:38:47,639 --> 02:38:50,558
It's the 3rd time this week
I've had to come looking for you.

977
02:38:50,558 --> 02:38:53,118
And where did I find you?
Where did I find you?

978
02:38:53,118 --> 02:38:56,528
On the other side of the island with
that gaddamn coconuts again!

979
02:38:56,528 --> 02:38:58,928
I can't take it anymore.

980
02:39:01,250 --> 02:39:03,841
Wait... Wilma... I'm sorry!

981
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:05,020
I'm sorry.

982
02:39:05,250 --> 02:39:06,680
It won't happen again.

983
02:39:07,150 --> 02:39:08,560
I'll take ou to the mall,

984
02:39:08,560 --> 02:39:10,900
(I'll buy you those shoes
you've always wanted.)

985
02:39:10,900 --> 02:39:12,861
We'll get a couples therapy.

986
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:14,450
(I'll do what he says.)

987
02:39:16,700 --> 02:39:17,750
Was that?

988
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:19,940
I guess so.

989
02:39:20,200 --> 02:39:21,260
A volley ball.

990
02:39:23,350 --> 02:39:24,550
Or something like that.

991
02:39:25,050 --> 02:39:26,660
- Lot of work shit on this island.
- Yeah.

992
02:39:26,660 --> 02:39:27,930
Let's get out of here.

993
02:39:41,850 --> 02:39:42,750
[*bicylcle ring*]

994
02:39:43,750 --> 02:39:44,670
What is that?

995
02:39:44,980 --> 02:39:46,470
It's take out, sir.

996
02:39:46,800 --> 02:39:48,830
- Take out?
- The special!

997
02:39:59,600 --> 02:40:00,460
Oh.

998
02:40:00,600 --> 02:40:06,140
*** for... for Mister the Supreme Kim?

999
02:40:06,290 --> 02:40:07,260
Oh...

1000
02:40:08,600 --> 02:40:10,090
Me?

1001
02:40:15,600 --> 02:40:17,130
Good job, man.

1002
02:40:17,390 --> 02:40:18,700
Come on!

1003
02:40:19,900 --> 02:40:20,900
Good job!

1004
02:40:35,500 --> 02:40:37,400
Psst. Where do you think is Kim, sir?

1005
02:40:37,400 --> 02:40:39,050
I don't know.
Just check every door.

1006
02:40:54,550 --> 02:40:56,800
Ouch... Jesus Christ!

1007
02:41:01,850 --> 02:41:03,760
God, honey, that's my face!

1008
02:41:07,650 --> 02:41:08,390
[*Aargh*]

1009
02:41:19,800 --> 02:41:20,480
Ouch!

1010
02:41:20,480 --> 02:41:21,690
Come on, come on.

1011
02:41:45,300 --> 02:41:46,820
Rachel! What are you doing?

1012
02:41:47,500 --> 02:41:49,549
- My first kill.
- You can't.

1013
02:41:50,100 --> 02:41:51,480
It'll cost too much commotion.

1014
02:41:51,600 --> 02:41:52,810
We got to rescue the Brits.

1015
02:42:09,500 --> 02:42:10,450
[*sighs of a woman*]

1016
02:42:14,800 --> 02:42:15,810
Loot at that.

1017
02:52:54,400 --> 02:52:55,380
Wow...

1018
02:52:55,380 --> 02:52:57,300
Now that was a sight, was it not?

1019
02:52:57,510 --> 02:52:59,390
Good god man! What are you doing?

1020
02:53:00,390 --> 02:53:02,810
Don't worry, sir. I know what to do.

1021
02:53:02,850 --> 02:53:05,480
Watson, no! Watson! Watson!

1022
02:53:05,500 --> 02:53:06,410
No!

1023
02:53:06,580 --> 02:53:08,590
No! Watson!

1024
02:53:09,000 --> 02:53:10,310
[*girls are screaming*]

1025
02:53:12,480 --> 02:53:14,540
Watson! Come on!

1026
02:53:17,250 --> 02:53:19,390
- *** this time, sir.
- No shit!

1027
02:53:21,100 --> 02:53:22,011
Shit!

1028
02:53:24,700 --> 02:53:26,660
Oh shit!
Aaaah!

1029
02:53:33,950 --> 02:53:35,050
Where are you idiot?

1030
02:53:35,340 --> 02:53:37,191
- Coming sir!
- Shit!

1031
02:53:40,300 --> 02:53:42,330
(Agent D, it's agent X.)

1032
02:53:42,420 --> 02:53:43,850
(Choppers are on route.)

1033
02:53:44,050 --> 02:53:45,680
(Meet is on the roof in half an hour.)

1034
02:53:45,680 --> 02:53:46,660
Copy, agent X.

1035
02:53:46,780 --> 02:53:48,160
Rooftop in half an hour.

1036
02:53:49,450 --> 02:53:50,500
That's over.

1037
02:53:55,050 --> 02:53:56,290
- Give me that.
- What?

1038
02:53:57,600 --> 02:53:58,950
- Let's go.
- Right.

1039
02:54:01,950 --> 02:54:03,069
- That's not ours.
- It's a souvenir!

1040
02:54:03,100 --> 02:54:04,720
Why not get souvenir?

1041
02:54:05,900 --> 02:54:07,151
Shhhh. Let's go.

1042
02:54:07,250 --> 02:54:08,370
(Sorry sir!)

1043
02:54:09,050 --> 02:54:11,300
- You hear that?
- This way.

1044
02:54:11,300 --> 02:54:12,850
You go ahead. I have an idea.

1045
02:54:22,250 --> 02:54:23,930
I won't betray my country!

1046
02:54:29,500 --> 02:54:30,750
Nothing. Nothing.

1047
02:54:39,050 --> 02:54:40,740
There are other ways.

1048
02:54:43,450 --> 02:54:46,471
Many ways. To make you talk.

1049
02:55:08,150 --> 02:55:08,730
No...

1050
02:55:10,000 --> 02:55:10,960
No...

1051
02:55:24,200 --> 02:55:25,030
No... Stop...

1052
02:55:29,800 --> 02:55:30,800
[Laughter]

1053
02:55:30,800 --> 02:55:31,790
Stop!

1054
02:55:36,650 --> 02:55:38,070
Stop! I'll tell everything!

1055
02:55:40,950 --> 02:55:43,150
Watson! Don't do it, man!

1056
02:55:43,150 --> 02:55:44,729
Get all yourself!

1057
02:56:00,600 --> 02:56:02,240
And after my parents divorced, I...

1058
02:56:02,240 --> 02:56:04,740
went to live in the English
countryside with my Nana.

1059
02:56:06,200 --> 02:56:09,540
She made the most ***

1060
02:56:09,540 --> 02:56:11,750
and a *** that I would have died for.

1061
02:56:11,750 --> 02:56:13,880
About auntie Gertrude,

1062
02:56:13,880 --> 02:56:16,380
she made some amazing ***

1063
02:56:17,900 --> 02:56:19,840
[*gunshots*]

1064
02:56:22,650 --> 02:56:26,170
George! Good George old chap!

1065
02:56:30,300 --> 02:56:31,560
Thanks for your help, George.

1066
02:56:42,850 --> 02:56:44,100
What's wrong with you, man? Huh?

1067
02:56:44,300 --> 02:56:46,130
Speak *** to the enemy like that?

1068
02:56:46,500 --> 02:56:47,760
What about your training, huh?

1069
02:56:48,000 --> 02:56:49,530
You're ***, you're ***

1070
02:56:51,750 --> 02:56:53,210
- Stop it, Stop it.
- Okay.

1071
02:56:56,500 --> 02:56:58,260
No wonder they didn't
make you a knight!

1072
02:57:01,900 --> 02:57:03,651
Get out of my sight.

1073
02:57:04,150 --> 02:57:06,520
Gonna have training *** with your fucking Nana.

1074
02:57:09,500 --> 02:57:12,070
Go. I never want to see your sorry
face around here again.

1075
02:57:21,900 --> 02:57:24,180
[*snorks*]

1076
02:57:27,000 --> 02:57:27,870
[*someone knocks the door*]

1077
02:57:44,100 --> 02:57:45,271
Enter.

1078
02:57:47,900 --> 02:57:48,800
Who are you?

1079
02:57:49,300 --> 02:57:52,349
Uh... the *** agency sent me.

1080
02:57:52,900 --> 02:57:53,610
Oh...

1081
02:57:53,610 --> 02:57:56,710
I bring you midnight snack.

1082
02:57:56,710 --> 02:57:59,870
Oh. That's excellent. I'm starving.

1083
02:58:08,150 --> 02:58:10,810
What this is? ***?

1084
02:58:12,700 --> 02:58:15,410
Just like a... ***.

1085
02:58:18,500 --> 02:58:20,800
[*coughs*]

1086
02:58:26,600 --> 02:58:27,700
That's right.

1087
02:58:29,200 --> 02:58:32,010
The taste, of your own medecine.

1088
02:58:41,200 --> 02:58:43,580
Yes! My first kill.

1089
02:58:45,300 --> 02:58:46,470
Rachel!

1090
02:58:47,500 --> 02:58:49,080
Well done my dear.

1091
02:58:49,600 --> 02:58:50,290
Thank you.

1092
02:58:51,300 --> 02:58:52,880
Now it looks like the
mission is complete.

1093
02:58:55,460 --> 02:58:56,900
He's dead.

1094
02:58:56,900 --> 02:58:58,041
Where's Watson?

1095
02:58:58,840 --> 02:59:00,370
Don't ask.

1096
02:59:02,600 --> 02:59:03,750
Who cares?

1097
02:59:04,750 --> 02:59:06,020
Well, it looks like the
mission is complete, then.

1098
02:59:06,400 --> 02:59:07,590
I guess I'll be off.

1099
02:59:08,600 --> 02:59:09,690
Come in Pegasus.

1100
02:59:09,690 --> 02:59:12,010
This is agent Jacks,
requesting transport.

1101
02:59:12,100 --> 02:59:13,230
Out.

1102
02:59:13,900 --> 02:59:15,071
***, agent D.

1103
02:59:18,600 --> 02:59:19,990
What was that about?

1104
02:59:21,050 --> 02:59:22,960
Some kind of lover's quarrel.

1105
02:59:25,050 --> 02:59:26,000
Right.

1106
02:59:26,521 --> 02:59:27,361
Well, let's get to the roof.

1107
02:59:27,361 --> 02:59:28,751
Agent X should be here in a minute.

1108
02:59:42,250 --> 02:59:42,970
[*Yay!*]

1109
02:59:49,600 --> 02:59:53,640
George!

1110
02:59:51,850 --> 02:59:53,540
Help please!

1111
02:59:56,600 --> 02:59:58,101
Well, well.

1112
03:00:02,850 --> 03:00:03,941
Help...

1113
03:00:04,941 --> 03:00:06,901
Sorry, it had to end this way, Rachel.

1114
03:00:07,200 --> 03:00:08,450
It's too bad, really.

1115
03:00:09,700 --> 03:00:10,800
Please, George...

1116
03:00:12,100 --> 03:00:14,841
Then just stay up, poor dumb secretary.

1117
03:00:16,750 --> 03:00:18,480
Please ***.

1118
03:00:19,300 --> 03:00:20,620
I'm a double agent.

1119
03:00:26,800 --> 03:00:28,360
No, I don't believe you.

1120
03:00:28,950 --> 03:00:31,350
Aaaaah! George, no!

1121
03:00:31,350 --> 03:00:32,400
Don't let go!

1122
03:00:32,979 --> 03:00:34,179
George!

1123
03:00:37,000 --> 03:00:37,920
Oh!

1124
03:00:38,440 --> 03:00:39,950
You are evil.

1125
03:00:41,900 --> 03:00:44,450
Rachel... Good bye.

1126
03:00:45,250 --> 03:00:46,320
Aaaaaah!

1127
03:00:46,700 --> 03:00:48,151
[*CRASH*]

1128
03:00:50,151 --> 03:00:51,271
[*Helicopters sounds*]

1129
03:01:01,800 --> 03:01:03,600
Come in, headquarters.

1130
03:01:03,600 --> 03:01:05,610
This is agent X.

1131
03:01:05,610 --> 03:01:08,470
Mission aborted.

1132
03:01:09,200 --> 03:01:10,520
I reapeat:

1133
03:01:10,900 --> 03:01:14,050
Mission aborted.
Over.

1134
03:01:20,000 --> 03:01:22,150
TO BE CONTINUED

1135
03:01:36,300 --> 03:01:38,010
Damnit!

1136
03:01:40,660 --> 03:01:41,890
Who's there?
