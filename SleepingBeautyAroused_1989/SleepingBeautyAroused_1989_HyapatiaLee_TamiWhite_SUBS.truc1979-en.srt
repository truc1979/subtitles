2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Day boys and girls,
we go tell a tale

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Oh sorry...
Simple Simon?

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Simple Simon tarts candy man?
Or is it kittens candy man?

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
This is'n horny story,
"Pipes, tits, cunts."

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The ministers seem so.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
A small political commentary

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
But seriously. Our story called Sleeping Beauty

9
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The small kingdom partied.
There was a princess born.

10
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The palace of King Ferdinand and koninginin Emilda.

11
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
... Preparing for the feast doping. The king...

12
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
... Made the night before to relax a ride.

13
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And King Ferdinand rode his favorite steed.

14
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
The good king Ferdinand will mean.

15
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
King Ferdinand was loved by his subjects.

16
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Most women would love to with him to bed

17
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
That did not apply to the Queen
That could explain why ...

18
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
... The king loved the beautiful, mysterious Marbella.

19
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Can I have a pillow under my knees?

20
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
No problem.
Give me just a kiss.

21
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Are you blind? There lies' t.

22
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I see no nut. That's it.

23
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
He really did not peek.

24
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It is not easy to play around with a king.

25
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Should the clerk really there?
- He has to protect me ..

26
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
He is professional, do not worry. He does not care.

27
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
But because you are my personal royal servant ...

28
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
... With all the rights and privileges I recommend you ...

29
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
... Right now to go suck my wiener.

30
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Yes, Your huge factor.

31
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,000
Go ahead.

32
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,000
The king was happy in his kingdom. Never there were epidemics.

33
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
But he was not prepared for Marbella's revelation.

34
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Hoogheidje, I gotta tell you something.

35
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Say it however.
- I'm a fairy.

36
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
A what?

37
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
A rotten fairy?

38
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You're a fairy?

39
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Brutal slut, that will cost you your head.

40
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
The sword, right now.

41
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
These are the crown jewels, crazy.

42
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Sorry, there goes your head. Fairy, huh?

43
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Not such a fee, you idiot.

44
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
No, what fairy then?

45
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Such a fairy enchants people. Never heard of Tinkerbell?

46
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
O which, like that I do know.

47
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
'S my cousin.

48
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I recognized 'r when she was Sylvia Schmidlap.

49
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I know still. I know her whole family.

50
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
How did you become a fairy?
- You do not get that you are.

51
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
This is not your environment

52
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I had a treasure of a mother and a pushover of a father.

53
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
You're not a bad fairy.

54
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Now I have love for you.

55
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Otherwise you bewitch me.

56
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I could never hurt you.
- No?

57
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
That's nice of you. I have bad news for you.

58
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I can not invite you to the celebration of doping.

59
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Why not, damn it?

60
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I'm not good enough for you? Starry bastard, bastard consumption

61
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
You're a coward. I enchant you into a frog.

62
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
No!

63
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Marbella No, stop it. The Queen gets us through.

64
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Bullshit, she has no idea what is happening here.

65
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I just feel 'r presence.
- You're paranoid, boy.

66
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Could I do something about it?

67
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,000
The festive banquet for the princess would soon begin.

68
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
The Count von Buckingham.

69
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Duke and Duchess of Gobbeldigoek.

70
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
And do not forget the good fairy Winnetka.

71
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Fairy?
- What's a medieval banquet ...

72
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
... No fairy?
- Good point, honey.

73
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
That's why I married you. Come with me.

74
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
'S Feast in honor of the birth of the princess will commence.

75
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Rather late, huh?

76
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
So I see the like.

77
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
What uncouth to eat at all if not all guests are there.

78
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,500
Who has del admitted?

79
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,000
I persuaded the guards.

80
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,000
That cost them their heads.
- Too late, queen

81
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Well not make such a fuss. For the sake of the small ones.

82
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:51,000
And the media there. Before you know it you doin 'throughout the country.

83
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Eat well but.
- Okay, make room for that agent.

84
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I hope she has brought one beautiful gift.

85
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Day, acid queen

86
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Who is that ugly child?

87
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:27,000
So they ate at that time, children. Now we do it neatly.

88
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
In those stories ...

89
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,000
That will need them. A royal bow and arrow.

90
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
After the party came the gifts.

91
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
But one of the attendees were not very nice.

92
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Suddenly the angry Marbella emerged.

93
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
She walked straight to the king and queen.

94
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
They start 't understand.

95
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Hello, Marvy, what is it?
- I 'm present ...

96
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
... Not given yet.
- You did not do.

97
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Wa sweet of her, huh?

98
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
In return for all your insults, I give you ...

99
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
... Something 't the same.

100
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
My gift to this child is a spell.

101
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
do not stop me if you balls you are sweet.

102
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
When she was 21 years her royal pussy ...

103
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
... So sharply licked she dies.

104
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Weep well but did not. Such a death is not so bad.

105
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
It's all your fault. If you know your royal sausage ...

106
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
... Had not gedouwd in her filthy slot, this never happened.

107
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
You are hysterical, calm down.
- Hi there.

108
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
There is also one good fairy.

109
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Oh yeah. Listen programs.

110
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
You can undo the spell?

111
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
That does not, but I'm changing a bit.

112
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Come on now.

113
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
How did she get that voice?

114
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Oh my God.

115
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Thou shalt not die. When the evil tongue appears ...

116
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,000
... Then she sleeps for 100 years.

117
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:51,000
She wakes up again only if there is a clean prince ...

118
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:58,000
... Those big throbbing member in her stops.

119
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Oh yeah, that's a lot better.

120
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
There are worse ways to be awakened.

121
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
A fairy can not work miracles. Some people are never satisfied.

122
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Halt. Who there?

123
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I'm the new night maker.
- Where's your uniform?

124
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I do not have it yet.
How did you get yours?

125
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Purchased.
You get nothing for nothing here.

126
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
As with Lenny.

127
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,000
No, Danny.

128
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Whatever.

129
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
You can borrow it tonight or mine.

130
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
That is nice of you.

131
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Remember, no one is allowed in the room of the princess.

132
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Simple enough.

133
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I'm so alone. No one comes to visit me once.

134
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I should not.

135
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Toee but you know, you can touch yourself out there it's ok.

136
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I can 't do.

137
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Why not?
- According to mom and dad ...

138
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,000
... There stenosis bad happens to me when I have sex for th 'm 21

139
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
What a misery ...

140
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Only two of us there, and I'm yours.

141
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
They have not said anything about having sex with yourself.

142
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Come on.

143
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Nice feeling.
- Well then, why not.?

144
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I'm wet.
- Then you're so excited.

145
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Go ahead, test t but s.

146
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
It tastes ...
- Say: "Sushi, I'll kill you."

147
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
What is Sushi?
- Forget it

148
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Now go on. Enjoy them.

149
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Strks then there is a big surprise for you.

150
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Nice feeling.

151
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Princess Amber had grown into a beautiful maiden.

152
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
She was raised by teachers and was thought and guarded night.

153
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:17,000
She often wondered what happened out there.

154
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
What does my body still strange.

155
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I've never felt anything like it.

156
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I've never felt anything like it.

157
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Could this be sex?

158
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
That little bump is so sensitive.

159
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Every time I rub it.

160
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Princess Amber liked the change-creations in her body ...

161
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
... Very interesting.

162
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,000
One of her ladies had 'r given a Danish book.

163
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Come m stop me, taartjessnoeper.

164
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Do not go away.
- The door was open.

165
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I looked to see if everything went well.
- Are you new?

166
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I am today for the first time.
- Nice uniform.

167
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Really?
I will not buy today.

168
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
It is not provided.
- Just like Lenny.

169
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
I thought it was Danny.
- Also good. Are you staying here?

170
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I would like to but ...
- I want to ask what ...

171
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:18,000
... men and women. You've got something beautiful between your legs.

172
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Yes, ma'am.

173
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I did indeed.
- May I kiss you 'ns?

174
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I should not be here.
- A little kiss but.

175
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,000
If they catch me ...
- Just one little kiss.

176
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,000
See?
It is nothing.

177
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I can not do this.

178
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
If they catch me free 't me my head.

179
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I will have to intervene themselves.

180
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,000
And if I ever there 's see, I'll throw you in the dungeon.

181
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
So fast that it makes you dizzy.

182
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Yes, ma'am.

183
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I pretty nearly. Come with me.

184
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Not now. Now go again.

185
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Why do they tease me so?

186
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Who is talking to himself is possessed by the devil.

187
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
I'm obsessed, but not by the devil.

188
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
A devil perhaps.

189
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Perhaps some are stars better than he believed.

190
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Go call him immediately.
- Who?

191
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
The king.

192
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
But he guards the princess.

193
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Will. Will the courier.

194
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Now go away.

195
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Who are you? Or is it you?

196
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Your Highness, I'm new here.

197
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
You need to bathe.

198
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Is it time already?
- I'll be happy when ...

199
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
... I'm 21 and tomorrow to get involved with other people.

200
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
It will not be long anymore. Shall we undress?

201
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
We? Dress Do you like?
- Yes, they did ...

202
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,000
... The previous castle too. I love 'm happy to dry clothes.

203
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Fine.

204
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,000
What has suddenly happened, queen? After all those years?

205
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
You desire me suddenly?
- I do not know.

206
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
'T Looks like I'm bewitched.

207
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
I ask but no further.

208
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:54,000
The princess is probably okay.
- Which princess do you mean?

209
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Yes it is.

210
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
You do certainly not contradict me?

211
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Just give me a rather nice turn.

212
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,000
We're talking still there's over.

213
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
I'm coming.

214
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Go ahead. Fuck it good.

215
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:19,000
The story suddenly goes fast.

216
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Meanwhile, was in a forest near the fairy Winnetka ...

217
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
... And do not worry, children, we're back in time ...

218
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,000
... The cum scene

219
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,000
I feel so ...

220
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
If you die?

221
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
What a bad luck.

222
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
What? Well damn ...

223
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,000
The sad fairy knew the princess now ...

224
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
... 100 years would sleep.

225
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Damn ... to let them sleep.

226
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Sleeping is nothing. She's been there.

227
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Evil fairy, lavish star of hundreds of pussies

228
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
You start to become common.
- I got your evil spell ...

229
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,000
...changed. They only sleep.

230
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
How do you get it in your head.

231
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Hikkerdekikker, you're a frog.

232
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Go eat tasty cockroaches, bitch.

233
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,000
And so everyone was put on hold in the castle.

234
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,000
While no one word in 1512 already knew.

235
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
The king.

236
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
The Queen, Will.

237
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
The watchmen Everyone.

238
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
And that would last 100 years.

239
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Fantastic, it works.

240
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,000
And as they slept last 100 years.

241
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Oh, my goodness. Is it already 100 years ago?

242
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
What a sweetheart.

243
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
And so handsome.

244
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:19,000
He is well suited to awaken the princess.

245
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:24,000
I had him myself first to be sure, but it's trying.

246
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,000
I'm very involved with 'm working.

247
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,000
They do not call me for anything the good fairy.

248
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Halt, who goes there?

249
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:41,000
I am a good fairy.
- No, no further.

250
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,000
I'm not used to fairies.

251
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Silly, I'm not such a fee.

252
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Boy, I got on my crotch tours never seen anything like it.

253
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:01,000
I have a special assignment for you. I need to know ...

254
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:06,000
... Your cock is worthy to break the spell.

255
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,000
My cock has a lot of hearts stolen and broken ...

256
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
... But not broken spells.

257
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Well, no longer lingered

258
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Clothe themselves princes' ns from?

259
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Yes, now, for example.

260
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Good.

261
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Well done.

262
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Yummy?
- Yes, hiccups have my treasure found.

263
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Do you want to know my opinion, Winnetka?

264
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Fuck, he's mine.
- You do everything 's nice work ...

265
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,000
...in this story.
- Come on, ladies.

266
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,000
I can not easily.

267
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:49,000
You may be doing bad. This is my lucky day.

268
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,000
He looks happy.

269
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Prince Rupert passed with flying colors the test.

270
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:09,000
He had now only to find the princess ...

271
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,000
... To break the spell.

272
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,000
She is a wonderful vision.

273
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:26,000
An angel from heaven.

274
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Well, I must do my duty.

275
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:44,000
You taste delicious.

276
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Is it that good?

277
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:00,000
I want to see you cum.

278
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Oh, my prince, you've come.

279
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:43,000
No, I mean that you came into my life.

280
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Cuddly hey, now the entire kingdom awakes again.

281
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
What are you doing here?

282
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
I'm at your firm.

283
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Pull him loose.

284
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Was is going on here?

285
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:25,000
I fell asleep. How long have I been asleep?

286
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:29,000
A year or a hundred.
- 100 years? I had 5 hours ...

287
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:34,000
... An appointment with Lancelot.
- They've missed you.

288
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Leave it there. No gelik to d'r pussy.

289
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:44,000
It does not hurt anymore. The spell has been worked out.

290
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
And they lived happily ever after.

291
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Really? Fantastic.

292
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:57,000
I'm going to tell the queen. We're going to celebrate.

293
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:04,000
No, no, do not go in there, King.

294
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:07,000
What is happening here?

295
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:11,000
That will cost you your head. And your balls. Come here, asshole.

296
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:20,000
And they lived happily ever after ...
