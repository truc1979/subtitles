2
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:43,600
You going somewhere?

3
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:49,790
Yeah, I gotta get up early in the morning.

4
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,990
You don't wanna stay the night?

5
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:57,490
John, can you help me zip this up?

6
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,350
My name is David.

7
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:28,740
It's nothing....personal.  You're a decent guy.

8
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:34,010
I'll let myself out.

9
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,850
Hey, what up dude?

10
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:00,330
What happened to that hottie you brought here last night?

11
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:01,970
The usual.

12
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:04,060
Yeah, she left.

13
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,090
Nailed and bailed, huh?

14
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:07,240
Yeah.

15
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,740
God, you're such a pig!

16
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,230
Whatever.  You just don't get it.

17
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:14,330
I'm just happy for the guy.

18
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:16,740
Yeah right.  Good one.

19
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,600
She didn't even know my name.

20
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,890
Remember when I used to wake up next to chicks and not know their name?

21
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,390
Sometimes you forget my name.

22
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:28,340
Of course you didn't stay the night.

23
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:30,030
Yeah.

24
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:30,940
Exactly.

25
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,190
So what are you bitching about?

26
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:34,820
Cause I'm sick of these one night stands!

27
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:38,320
How often is this going to happen?

28
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,850
This eternal spiral I keep going down.

29
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:43,870
I wanna girl I can actually hang out with.

30
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:46,680
A girl I can play video games with.

31
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,730
You don't even play video games.

32
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:52,230
Yeah Vickie.  That's besides the point.

33
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,970
I guess...

34
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:58,470
I guess it's not really Maggie, but...

35
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:01,970
I guess, I'm not really out there looking for "the one".

36
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:05,470
Uhh, uhh, I guess I'm looking, but...

37
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:08,400
I'm not...not really expecting to find her.

38
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:14,180
Well, maybe if you stopped looking in dive bars!

39
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:17,090
Well, it's the only place I'm comfortable talking to girls.

40
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:19,000
You get a few drinks in me and I,....

41
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,280
..loosen up.  I'm never going to see them again, so I'm not gonna mess it up.

42
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,410
You know it....?

43
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:29,720
When it comes to a girl you really wanna...

44
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:33,220
...spend time with its like...

45
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,540
...something different.

46
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:39,050
You know what it is?  I freeze up.  I get nervous.

47
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:42,930
I start sweating.  I'm afraid I'm gonna do the wrong thing; say the wrong thing.

48
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:44,950
...make the whole thing awkward.  Just ruin the moment.

49
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:47,180
Epic fail, bro!  Epic fail.

50
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:50,680
You just gotta get out of that comfort zone your in, man.

51
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,660
Get out of my comfort zone?

52
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:52,130
Yeah.

53
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:54,580
This coming from a guy who hasn't put on a pair of pants in 2 months.

54
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:57,790
Shut up!  You don't even know how hard it is to live this lifestyle.

55
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:00,010
Oh my god, I'm sure it's so difficult.

56
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:03,030
I'm sure it'd be a lot more difficult if you didn't have a bunch of rich dead relatives.

57
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:04,850
Hey!

58
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:07,530
Just because he's willfully unemployed...

59
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:09,770
...does not mean he doesn't work hard.

60
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:12,030
He's dating me.

61
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:14,150
Damn straight!

62
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:19,880
We're gonna find you a girl, David.

63
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:25,010
Don't strain yourself.

64
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:49,000
Hey.

65
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,860
Hey.

66
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,030
What about the neighbor?

67
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:55,470
You know the one with the cute dog.  The one that David has a crush on?

68
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:56,550
I'm right here.

69
00:21:56,550 --> 00:22:00,020
Oh, wait, not the dog...the girl.

70
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,450
Thanks for pointing that out.

71
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,490
I got that.

72
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:05,260
Never mind.  Hey David...

73
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,090
Hmmm?

74
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:09,590
Will you get..uh...will you go get the newspaper?

75
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:11,470
Will you go get the newspaper?

76
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:13,490
Cause, I don't want to miss this level.

77
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:17,290
It's level 30, and we're gonna get wings.  Will you go get it?

78
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:20,790
Oh!  Fine.

79
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,290
Anything else?

80
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:25,720
The paper.

81
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:45,480
Boz.  Boz, where are you?

82
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:48,450
Hi!

83
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,480
Hi.

84
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:56,220
Boz.  Walking your dog, huh?

85
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,930
More like he's walking me.

86
00:22:57,930 --> 00:22:59,380
Hi.  I'm Jen.

87
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,960
I'm John...

88
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,230
...Uh, I'm David.  My name's David.

89
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:05,930
Great.

90
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:08,600
Guess I'll see you around then, David.

91
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:12,100
Yeah!  See you.  See you around.

92
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:15,600
I'm John!?!

93
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:18,400
What the hell is wrong with me?

94
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,970
Hey Meg.  I was just thinking about calling you.

95
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:50,770
Oh my god!  Me  too!

96
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:53,890
And then I did, because I know exactly what you need right now.

97
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,430
Retail therapy!

98
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:56,970
I'm not going shopping.

99
00:23:56,970 --> 00:24:02,140
Why not?  I thought you said you moved to LA to stop moping around and get on with your life.

100
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:05,640
That and to be close to me and my AWESOMENESS!

101
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,620
And the whole moving on thing too.

102
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,450
Whatever.  So you ready?  You wanna go?

103
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:12,220
I have too much unpacking to do.

104
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:15,230
Then don't.  Fill your closets with new stuff.

105
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:18,190
Come on.  It will be good for you to get out and meet other people.

106
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,870
I just talked to someone.

107
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:22,080
A neighbor.  We had a perfectly normal conversation.

108
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,260
Perfectly normal.  So there's nothing to worry about.

109
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:28,130
OK.  Seriously, Jen, you need new clothes.

110
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:29,460
I didn't want to be mean about it.

111
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:32,120
But your stuff is from like, eons ago.

112
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,110
It's kind of getting embarrassing.

113
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:37,610
Have you seriously not been shopping since you've been single?

114
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:39,360
Fine.  I'll go.

115
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,350
Great.  OK if Audrey comes too?

116
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:43,730
Sure.  Awesome. See you in a bit.

117
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,850
[Doorbell.  Knocking]

118
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,950
Hey girl.  You ready to go yet?

119
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:01,450
We just got off the phone?

120
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:04,950
I'll go get my shoes.

121
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:10,960
She must think the world waits for her.

122
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,460
Some people can be so inconsiderate.

123
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:17,960
Hey doggie.

124
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,110
Ready to go?

125
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:28,470
Jen.  This is way to close to pastels...

126
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,490
These were on their way out 5 minutes ago.

127
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:35,570
No one wears this blend of cotton and rayon anymore.

128
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:37,190
They just don't.

129
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,080
Come on let's go.

130
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:57,190
Do you see me in your cross hairs?

131
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:58,940
Not right now.

132
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,350
What are you doing out here little buddy?

133
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:19,850
Look at you.

134
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:29,610
Let's go inside.

135
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:34,190
Stop!

136
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:37,690
Check it out!

137
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:39,860
Look what I found in the backyard.

138
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:43,360
Oh, it's a puppy!  Let me see 'im!

139
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,420
Hi!

140
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:48,540
What an angel!

141
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,300
Seriously?

142
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,790
Get back over here.  We're almost at the next save point.

143
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,290
I love you!

144
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,790
What's his name?

145
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:01,420
His name is Boz.

146
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,250
Hi Boz.

147
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:05,470
Hey this is that girl's dog, huh?

148
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:06,490
Mmm hmm.

149
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:08,250
Come on.  Come on.  Get back in the game.

150
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:10,230
...Not going to wait all day.

151
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:12,910
Oh, I love you.  Isn't he cute?  Isn't he sweet?

152
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:14,340
Ah, come on.

153
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,070
What, you...?

154
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:16,160
Isn't he sweet?

155
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,710
You really think this thing is cute?

156
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:21,680
My ovaries are just throbbing.  I love him so much.

157
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,710
OK.  It's time to go buddy.

158
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:25,930
Hey.  Wait a minute man.

159
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:27,720
You know what you can do?

160
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,940
What's that?

161
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:31,380
You want to get to know that girl right?

162
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,110
Yeah.

163
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:33,190
Well.

164
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:35,400
Instead of bringing this guy back right away...

165
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,460
How 'bout you keep him, and offer to help her find him?

166
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,710
Wow, that is terrible!

167
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:43,960
That way when you give him back in a few days...you're a hero!

168
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,150
That is terrible!

169
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:48,720
That's one of the worst ideas I've ever heard!

170
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,310
I don't know about that.

171
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:53,810
Remember peanut butter chili fries?

172
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:55,610
No, dude, no.

173
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:57,860
Come here.  Bye baby.

174
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,480
See you later.

175
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,320
Get away from these crazies, huh?

176
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:05,820
Huh.  Peanut butter chili fries were pretty bad.

177
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:43,980
Looks like you're going to be staying with me tonight.

178
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:46,350
At least for a little while.

179
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:49,850
Don't look all excited or anything.

180
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:52,280
Let's go.

181
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:00,530
She wasn't home.

182
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,520
I'm not doing it.

183
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:30,190
Boz!

184
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:33,690
Bozzie!  Mama's home.

185
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,580
Boz.

186
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:45,080
Bozzie.  C'mere.

187
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:52,230
Bozzie.

188
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,100
Boz, where are you?

189
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:57,410
Boz!

190
00:29:57,410 --> 00:30:00,910
Bozzie!

191
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:04,410
Where are you?  Boz!  This isn't funny!

192
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:07,120
Bozley, where are you?

193
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,680
Boz!

194
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,350
Bozley, come on!

00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:23,850

Boz!

198
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:31,630
Hello.

199
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:33,480
Hey, Jennie, I almost forgot to tell you.

200
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,530
Boz is gone!

201
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:35,860
I looked all over the house!

202
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:39,360
...in the backyard...everywhere!  I can't find him!

203
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:42,110
Well honey, do you want us to circle back?

204
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:45,610
No.  It's OK.  I'll go ask neighbors, I guess.

205
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:48,130
Well if you don't find him, I'll help you post fliers.

206
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:50,190
I'll even design them for you.

207
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:53,000
I have some awesome ideas.

208
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,140
Um...OK.

209
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:58,640
OK.  Well I know you'll love them.

210
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:13,360
Dude c'mon.  What are you doing?

[Doorbell]

212
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:26,550
What?

213
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:28,840
Jen!  Remember.

214
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,410
The plan dude.

215
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,740

Damn it.

00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:46,280
OK.  OK.  Here goes.

218
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:51,940
OK.  You got this.  You got this.

219
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:53,860
What's up Jen?

220
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:04,710
My Bozley, he's gone!

221
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:07,180
I've been running around asking all the neighbors.  Nobody's seen him.

222
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:10,660
OK.  Well just calm down.  Everything's going to be OK.

223
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,250
No!  It's not OK!

224
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:13,450
He's not just my baby!

225
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:14,380
He's a valuable dog.

226
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:16,170
Somebody might have kidnapped him.

227
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:18,670
He's not a puppy anymore.

228
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:21,960
He's only 4.  But in dog-years, it's like late 20's.

229
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,620
Oh my gosh!  I don't know what I'm gonna do!

230
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:25,540
Jennifer.  What?!

231
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,040
What?!

232
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:31,630
What?!  What is it?

233
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:35,570
If you want I can help you out.

234
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:40,600
Find him.  The Bozley.  The dog.

235
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:44,100
You know, put out fliers.

236
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,970
Ask around the neighborhood.

237
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:49,810
Do you want me to help you find him?

238
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,350
What do you think?

239
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:21,980
Cubism crossed with abstract expressionism.

Just a hint of ransom note.

241
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:28,110
It's a poster for Jen's missing dog.

242
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,610
Oh!  Contextual narrative!

243
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:38,600
So it's commentary on the desperate plight of the lost dogs in all of us?

244
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,090
How'd you think of that?

245
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:43,590
Jen's dog is really missing.

246
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,740
Oh!  A real time inspiration.

247
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:49,240
No. I mean, she asked me to make these posters to put around town.

248
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:54,160
What?  What is so funny?

249
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:59,490
Well, for starters, the info is barely legible.

250
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:01,690
That drawing looks nothing like Jen's dog.

251
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:03,860
I wanted to catch people's attention.

252
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:06,350
People will see it and try to read it.

253
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:10,380
Some of them will've seen Jen's dog and one of them will call her.

254
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:16,430
Jen's going to love...

255
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:19,370
Uhh.  Shut up!  What do you know?

256

You're an elitist art snob who can't appreciate art unless you put it into one of your -isms.

This is the post I write...

258

So this is the post I write...blah...blah...

Oh, real mature Meg!

Oh, real mature, Meg!

You see, when you resort to this, I win.

00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:37,330
I win!

263
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,830
OK you win.  I win.

264
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:15,180
Oh, just like that.

265
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:15,180
Sensitive.  Yes always.

266
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:36,430
I don't want you to tease me too much.

Oh my gosh, it feels so good!

268
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:06,030
Don't stop. Don't stop. Don't stop!

00:53:26,990 --> 00:53:29,180
I win!  You win.

So, is Bozley really...important to you?

271
00:53:57,740 --> 00:54:01,240
Yeah.  He's everything.

272
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:03,800
He's the only one that's ever been loyal.

273
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:07,300
He's never lied to me...cheated on me.

274
00:54:08,670 --> 00:54:11,960
God I'm so neurotic!

275
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:15,460
It's just that after the divorce...it was tough.

276
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:18,960
I moved out here to get away from everybody.

277
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:22,460
Everyone except for Meg.  You can't ever get away from Meg.

278
00:54:23,830 --> 00:54:28,590
Oh...you mean...have you been like...

279
00:54:28,590 --> 00:54:32,540
...dating anybody?  No!

280
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:35,230
And don't ask me why not.

281
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:39,590
If one more person asks me I swear I'm going to scream.  Understood.

282
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:45,030
Buy why not?  I feel like used merchandise.

283
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:48,530
Used merchandise?  You're not used merchandise!

284
00:54:50,590 --> 00:54:53,850
At most...you're experienced.

285
00:54:57,270 --> 00:55:01,530
OK.  That might not have sounded right, but you know what I mean.

286
00:55:01,530 --> 00:55:05,030
My friend Meg says I have guilt issues.

287
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:10,250
That until I learn to forgive others, I won't ever forgive myself.

288
00:55:10,750 --> 00:55:13,070
But she says a lot of things.  She's crazy.

289
00:55:13,330 --> 00:55:17,130
Anyway.  Enough about me, what's your story?

290
00:55:17,790 --> 00:55:19,330
My story?

291
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:25,010
Well, I can some that up in about 12 words.

292
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:28,020
I was born..

293
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:30,260
I work in a cubicle.

294
00:55:30,670 --> 00:55:33,570
And one day I'll die.

295
00:55:33,570 --> 00:55:37,070
Minus the "and", that will make it 13.

296
00:55:38,330 --> 00:55:40,570
True romantic.

297
00:55:40,570 --> 00:55:44,380
But seriously though...no family?

298
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:47,050
No kids?  No dreams?

299
00:55:47,050 --> 00:55:51,530
Yeah dreams, but the whole family thing, it just...

300
00:55:51,530 --> 00:55:55,030
It starts out like, you meet a nice girl...

301
00:55:55,030 --> 00:55:57,660
...I mean the right girl, whatever.

302
00:55:57,660 --> 00:55:59,990
I'm just never good at that.

303
00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:02,680
Talking to girls, meeting girls...

304
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:06,180
...I really just...haven't met the right girl yet.

305
00:56:08,270 --> 00:56:10,170
That's sweet.

306
00:56:10,770 --> 00:56:14,870
Assuming, it's not just a come on.

307
00:56:16,090 --> 00:56:18,370
It's not just a come on.

308
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:25,400
But, I really do envy you.

309
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:27,920
I had a dream once.

310
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:31,700
For 2 years I felt like I was failing...

311
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:34,300
...trying to grab onto something solid.

312
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:37,800
Boz is what kept me together.

313
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:50,830
It's getting a little late.  The sun is starting to go down.

314
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:56,110
Think maybe we should call it a night?

315
00:56:56,360 --> 00:57:01,790
You think? He's not supposed to be by himself after dark.

316
00:57:01,790 --> 00:57:05,290
I'm sure he's fine.  It's not like...

317
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:07,940
I'm sure somebody's found him by now.

318
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:11,440
Probably wandered into somebody's back yard...

319
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:13,960
...nestled up in a blanket somewhere.

320
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:17,460
He probably just had a full belly of food and he's ready to sleep.

321
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:18,960
No, here look.

322
00:57:18,930 --> 00:57:20,810
Let's just make some fliers tomorrow.

323
00:57:20,810 --> 00:57:26,280
Let's meet up have a coffee or something and then start putting them up around the neighborhood.

324
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:28,480
I like that.

325
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:31,320
Yeah?  Alright.

326
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:33,220
Well, um...

327
00:57:37,730 --> 00:57:41,190
Thanks.  Yeah.

328
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,690
See you tomorrow.

329
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:09,460
Jen!  I hope Boz is still lost because I made the posters!

330
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:15,610
How did you get in here?

331
00:58:17,150 --> 00:58:18,730
Did I leave the door unlocked?

332
00:58:19,990 --> 00:58:24,640
I drew Boz as a character to exaggerate his features to make him a little bit cuter.

333
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:27,910
You know people are more likely to return cute dogs than ugly dogs.

334
00:58:27,910 --> 00:58:33,590
Like wow!  What happened to that dog?  Would I really want to return him to his owner?

335
00:58:33,590 --> 00:58:35,600
What are you talking about?

336
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:37,300
You can't even read it.

337
00:58:37,770 --> 00:58:39,290
I made my own posters.

338
00:58:39,290 --> 00:58:41,920
David, my neighbor, is going to help me post them.

339
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:44,650
I told you I was making them.

340
00:58:44,910 --> 00:58:48,150
Right, um, well I knew yours would be better.

341
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:51,890
So I figured that you could post them downtown.

342
00:58:51,890 --> 00:58:53,380
Where more people could see 'em.

343
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:56,420
And then I'll just post the boring ugly ones around the neighborhood.

344
00:58:56,420 --> 00:58:59,920
For brilliance!  We'll find Boz in no time!

345
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:03,680
Did I just kill you?

346
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:04,700
You did not.

347
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:08,200
But nice...nice try.

348
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:09,860
I'm gonna kill you right now though.

349
00:59:12,690 --> 00:59:15,760
In your face!  That's how I do it.

350
00:59:16,550 --> 00:59:20,050
Whatever.  Something's wrong with this level.  It's lagging or something.

351
00:59:20,050 --> 00:59:24,730
Oh, OK.  It's lagging.  That's why I just blasted your face!

352
00:59:24,730 --> 00:59:27,440
Are you gonna cry about it Halo champion?

353
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:30,940
Oh, you gonna give me some tears?  Some third place tears?

354
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:34,440
You know it was second place.  Don't give me that crap.

355
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:36,010
Oh a technicality.

356
00:59:36,010 --> 00:59:39,510
That's not...No don't!

357
00:59:39,510 --> 00:59:43,010
Don't poke me I hate it!

358
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:50,510
That's her at the door!  Hide the dog!  Hide the dog!

359
01:00:05,620 --> 01:00:08,230
Hey.  You gonna pass out some fliers?

360
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:11,030
Yep.  Can I use your bathroom for a second?

361
01:00:11,030 --> 01:00:14,530
Yeah.

362
01:00:14,530 --> 01:00:16,810
Straight back here.

363
01:00:16,810 --> 01:00:19,450
It's Steve.  Good to meet you.

364
01:00:19,450 --> 01:00:21,010
I know right?

365
01:00:21,490 --> 01:00:24,510
It's just straight back.

366
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:33,330
Dude!  I hid Bozley right next to the bathroom!

367
01:00:33,330 --> 01:00:36,250
What?!  Why would you do that?

368
01:00:50,180 --> 01:00:52,380
Hey.  Hey.  Got any TP?

369
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:55,380
Yeah.  Yeah.  We have toilet paper.

370
01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:57,760
It should be...under the sink.

371
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:00,180
Got ya.  Thanks.

372
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:15,330
Do you have a dog?  No.  Why?

373
01:01:15,330 --> 01:01:18,460
Oh.  Nothing.  The bathroom just smelled a little funny.

374
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:21,640
Oh...yeah....that's...

375
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:24,830
...that's residual body odor.

376
01:01:24,830 --> 01:01:28,330
That is...my roommate has this condition.

377
01:01:28,330 --> 01:01:30,600
...If he sweats it smells like wet dog.

378
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:32,110
It's gross.

379
01:01:32,110 --> 01:01:34,110
It's true.  It's true.

380
01:01:34,110 --> 01:01:36,010
She said so too.

381
01:01:36,810 --> 01:01:37,550
You ready to go?

382
01:01:37,550 --> 01:01:41,050
Yeah.  You got your flier?  Yeah.

383
01:01:41,050 --> 01:01:44,550
See you later.  Later.

384
01:01:47,290 --> 01:01:49,300
Now where were we?

385
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:52,800
I think we were at level 3, 3rd base.

386
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:56,300
Baseline.

387
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:01,850
They just talk too much.

388
01:02:01,850 --> 01:02:04,050
Think so?

389
01:02:04,050 --> 01:02:06,630
They need to learn to shut up.

390
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:09,400
Just shut the fuck up.

391
01:02:19,030 --> 01:02:20,830
You being proactive?

392
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:41,670
What will it take to get you off this couch?

393
01:02:41,670 --> 01:02:44,440
I dunno.

394
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:47,940
In that case, I'm stroking your cock.

395
01:02:59,110 --> 01:03:02,240
Oh I got you off the couch.

396
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:09,630
I'm really tight.

397
01:03:24,910 --> 01:03:27,500
Let's take these off too.

398
01:03:32,750 --> 01:03:36,500
Yes, kiss me.  Worship me.

399
01:04:20,950 --> 01:04:25,310
Your dirty fingers.  Take them out and feed them to me.

400
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:14,270
Give me your mouth.  Give me your mouth.

401
01:05:22,780 --> 01:05:24,020
come here.

402
01:06:05,430 --> 01:06:07,540
Yummy.

403
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:19,030
Yeah, look at me with those pretty eyes while you suck it.

404
01:06:19,870 --> 01:06:22,530
You're so romantic.

405
01:06:22,530 --> 01:06:26,530
You're so romantic while I suck your cock.

406
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:37,120
Are you trying to put it deep in my mouth?

407
01:06:38,130 --> 01:06:39,970
Yeah, put it way down there.

408
01:06:45,250 --> 01:06:47,310
That's so fucking good baby!

409
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:17,850
I wanna fuckkkk.

410
01:07:17,850 --> 01:07:20,950
Let's fuck.  Let's fuck.

411
01:08:34,030 --> 01:08:36,370
I love that fucking hair!

412
01:10:04,940 --> 01:10:06,600
You wanna see that booty?

413
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:08,220
Fuck yeah.  Come here.

414
01:10:40,210 --> 01:10:42,110
Yeah, looks so fucking good!

415
01:13:14,130 --> 01:13:18,120
You feel so fucking tight.

416
01:13:23,250 --> 01:13:25,170
You gonna go deep?

417
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:57,020
It's swallowing up your dick.

418
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:50,480
It's so beautiful!

419
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:52,960
I love making you come.

420
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:09,560
Oh my god!

421
01:18:16,420 --> 01:18:18,250
Thank you.

422
01:20:28,140 --> 01:20:30,790
I wanna tell you about the dog.

423
01:20:30,790 --> 01:20:32,780
I can't let this go any longer.

424
01:20:32,780 --> 01:20:35,340
What?!  You can't quit now.

425
01:20:35,340 --> 01:20:38,840
This is wrong!  I like her so much and I'm lying to her!

426
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:43,230
The only thing that got me talking to her in the first place.

427
01:20:43,230 --> 01:20:45,140
I really like this chick.

428
01:20:45,140 --> 01:20:48,640
Good for you Dave.

429
01:20:49,050 --> 01:20:52,140
Just give me the dog.  Come on Boz, it's time to go home.

430
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:56,550
I can't let you do that Dave.

431
01:20:56,550 --> 01:20:57,610
Come on seriously.

432
01:20:57,610 --> 01:21:01,110
Seriously, what are you gonna do?  What are you gonna say to her?

433
01:21:01,110 --> 01:21:05,060
Here's your dog I've been hiding from you for a few days while I helped you find it!

434
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:09,070
How's she gonna take that?  Like how do you think that's gonna work?

435
01:21:09,070 --> 01:21:12,570
Good luck with that 'bro.

436
01:21:13,780 --> 01:21:16,070
Damnit you're right.

437
01:21:27,110 --> 01:21:31,400
You know...I knew you were a great guy when I met you.

438
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:35,390
Yeah.  Yeah.  How'd you know that?

439
01:21:35,390 --> 01:21:38,290
Because Boz liked you.

440
01:21:38,290 --> 01:21:40,660
Boz only likes good people.

441
01:21:40,660 --> 01:21:42,560
He hated my ex.

442
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:46,060
Even though he was a Christmas present from the bastard.

443
01:21:48,580 --> 01:21:52,610
You know I'm not that good of a guy.

444
01:21:52,610 --> 01:21:54,750
You're right.

445
01:21:55,780 --> 01:21:58,250
You're a great guy.

446
01:22:02,690 --> 01:22:04,140
I have to tell you something.

447
01:22:04,140 --> 01:22:05,900
What's that?

448
01:22:09,390 --> 01:22:11,690
What's that?!

449
01:22:11,690 --> 01:22:15,190
Oh!

450
01:22:15,140 --> 01:22:17,810
Bozley!  What is this?!

451
01:22:17,810 --> 01:22:20,360
Uh, hey Jen!

452
01:22:21,650 --> 01:22:25,750
We forgot to tell you that an hour ago, a couple of blocks away, we found...

453
01:22:25,750 --> 01:22:27,390
...Boz wondering around.

454
01:22:27,390 --> 01:22:29,640
...we thought...

455
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:33,140
Steve, it's over.  Forget about it.

456
01:22:34,210 --> 01:22:38,320
You.  You were the one who took my dog?

457
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:40,540
It wasn't like that.

458
01:22:42,350 --> 01:22:44,040
He wandered into our yard, and...

459
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:46,660
...You let me believe he was missing while you...!

460
01:22:46,660 --> 01:22:49,610
...helped me look?  It's not like that.

461
01:22:49,610 --> 01:22:53,110
What kind of person does that?!

462
01:22:53,570 --> 01:22:55,310
A bad one.  I don't know.

463
01:22:55,310 --> 01:22:58,810
What's wrong with you?!

464
01:22:58,810 --> 01:23:02,310
Oh!!!

465
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:07,950
All of you!  You're all deranged!

466
01:23:07,950 --> 01:23:11,450
Don't ever contact me again!

467
01:23:17,950 --> 01:23:19,870
Game over dude.

468
01:23:24,860 --> 01:23:27,180
Of course you should be angry, Jen!

469
01:23:27,180 --> 01:23:29,060
Furious!

470
01:23:29,060 --> 01:23:32,560
I know, but the anger always turns into guilt.

471
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:34,450
Guilt?!

472
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:38,250
Roger, we can't expect you to understand.

473
01:23:38,250 --> 01:23:41,200
Maybe Jen feels guilty for yelling at David.

474
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:44,700
I mean you have to admit what he did was pretty cute.

475
01:23:46,030 --> 01:23:48,740
If you think so...

476
01:23:48,740 --> 01:23:50,390
Look.

477
01:23:50,390 --> 01:23:54,930
He turned out to be a great guy, right?  And no harm came to Boz.

478
01:23:54,930 --> 01:23:58,430
And you said it yourself.  Boz liked him right?

479
01:23:59,620 --> 01:24:01,930
You realize how crazy that sounds right?

480
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:06,390
You're saying that she should go by what the dog thinks?

481
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:12,440
And this guy lied to you from the very moment you met him.  What kind of relationship you supposed to build out of that?

482
01:24:31,750 --> 01:24:37,210
David?  David?

483
01:24:37,210 --> 01:24:40,710
David!  You need to go outside.

484
01:24:40,710 --> 01:24:41,830
You need to get out of the house.

485
01:24:41,830 --> 01:24:46,030
Because your self pity...is stinking up the place.

486
01:24:46,030 --> 01:24:49,530
I can't.  I'm helping Steve.

487
01:24:49,530 --> 01:24:53,030
Damn straight!

488
01:24:53,030 --> 01:24:55,920
No.  You need to go out tonight.

489
01:24:56,150 --> 01:24:58,850
Because I need to air out this house.

490
01:24:58,850 --> 01:25:01,420
Because it reeks of depression!

491
01:25:01,420 --> 01:25:04,920
Get up!  Get out of the house!

492
01:25:13,210 --> 01:25:14,830
Sissy's in here.

493
01:25:14,830 --> 01:25:18,330
Oh!  That's right.

494
01:26:17,620 --> 01:26:19,800
Do you come here often?

495
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:21,560
What?

496
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:25,060
I said, do you come here often?  I've never seen you before.

497
01:26:25,060 --> 01:26:29,080
What?  I haven't seen you here.

498
01:26:29,080 --> 01:26:31,420
Do you come here often?

499
01:26:38,690 --> 01:26:41,480
You're not gonna remember my name are you?

500
01:26:48,860 --> 01:26:50,430
My name's David.

501
01:26:50,430 --> 01:26:52,570
Taylor?

502
01:26:53,810 --> 01:26:56,070
DAVID!

503
01:26:56,880 --> 01:26:58,660
Taylor.

504
01:27:00,180 --> 01:27:02,830
Yeah.  My name's Taylor.

505
01:27:07,420 --> 01:27:09,640
What are you drinking?

506
01:28:12,860 --> 01:28:14,430
Hey Jen.

507
01:28:14,430 --> 01:28:16,640
Wait.  Wait.  Wait.

508
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:19,730
OK.  Just give me 2 minutes.  OK.

509
01:28:19,730 --> 01:28:22,310
And you'll never have to deal with us again.

510
01:28:22,310 --> 01:28:24,440
What do you want?

511
01:28:25,260 --> 01:28:29,170
I think you have the wrong idea about what happened.

512
01:28:29,170 --> 01:28:32,060
I think I understand perfectly well what's going on.

513
01:28:32,060 --> 01:28:33,600
I don't think you do.

514
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:37,750
Dave has had a crush on you since you moved into the neighborhood.  OK?

515
01:28:37,750 --> 01:28:43,310
And he is so shy, I had to trick him into talking to you last Saturday.

516
01:28:44,710 --> 01:28:49,280
OK.  What I'm trying to say is that this was all Steve's idea.

517
01:28:49,820 --> 01:28:53,060
OK.  Dave found Boz in the backyard.

518
01:28:53,060 --> 01:28:54,370
I don't know how he got there.

519
01:28:54,370 --> 01:28:57,290
But he returned him to your house, but you weren't there.

520
01:28:57,290 --> 01:28:59,290
So he brought him back to our house.

521
01:28:59,290 --> 01:29:02,790
And Steve came up with this idea.  Dave thought it was stupid...

522
01:29:02,790 --> 01:29:05,550
It is really stupid because Steve is really stupid.

523
01:29:05,550 --> 01:29:09,050
And...he just got mixed up in it.

524
01:29:09,630 --> 01:29:12,930
I don't care who's idea it was.  He still lied to me.

525
01:29:12,930 --> 01:29:14,880
I know but he tried to tell you.

526
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:16,330
But he didn't!

527
01:29:16,330 --> 01:29:20,220
OK.  He's a moron.  He is.  OK?

528
01:29:20,220 --> 01:29:24,700
But he's not as big a moron as you think he is.

529
01:29:24,700 --> 01:29:29,130
OK.  It really hurt him to lie to you.

530
01:29:29,130 --> 01:29:33,420
So what?  He sent you over here to beg for my forgiveness?

531
01:29:33,420 --> 01:29:36,920
No.  He doesn't even know I'm here.

532
01:29:36,920 --> 01:29:39,420
But would you forgive him if he did?

533
01:29:39,930 --> 01:29:41,670
Would you forgive him?

534
01:29:41,670 --> 01:29:45,170
Jen.  Your 2 minutes are up.  No Jen.

535
01:29:45,650 --> 01:29:48,670
We totally played D & D together sometime.

536
01:31:52,030 --> 01:31:55,170
Boz, c'mere.

537
01:31:58,500 --> 01:32:05,090
You wanna play fetch?  Let's go.

538
01:32:15,250 --> 01:32:18,550
Say, you OK?

539
01:33:01,680 --> 01:33:04,910
What's this?

540
01:33:05,700 --> 01:33:09,660
Hi.  Hi.

541
01:33:13,150 --> 01:33:19,710
I miss you too.  But don't think all is forgiven.

542
01:33:19,710 --> 01:33:22,370
I wouldn't...

543
01:33:22,370 --> 01:33:25,870
Cause what you did is pretty terrible.

544
01:33:26,980 --> 01:33:32,100
Yeah.  Look, I don't even know where to start.

545
01:33:32,100 --> 01:33:34,520
...with the apology.

546
01:33:34,520 --> 01:33:40,220
You already have.  I'm the one who's been holding back.

547
01:33:40,220 --> 01:33:45,440
So...I'm sorry.

548
01:33:46,940 --> 01:33:50,950
But I still resent you for having to forgive you.

549
01:33:51,610 --> 01:33:54,450
Well I'm sorry.

550
01:33:58,200 --> 01:34:01,890
Should I thank you?

551
01:34:01,890 --> 01:34:05,390
Yeah.  Somewhere in there.
