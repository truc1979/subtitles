178
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:37,700
I think it's a great idea okay

179
00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:39,070
virtually to date this guy you know

180
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:44,050
makes me feel better why not you know

181
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:44,050

marriage is right for me see that's all

314
01:07:42,420 --> 01:07:46,500
you have to say well I didn't think

315
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:48,420
you'd want to hear it

316
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:52,410
you know especially after your friend

317
01:07:48,420 --> 01:07:54,930
tells you her proposal story no no honey

318
01:07:52,410 --> 01:07:56,520

319
01:07:54,930 --> 01:07:59,400
about how you feel about marriage

320
01:07:56,520 --> 01:08:01,020
and that's tough enough but why you

321
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:05,840
thought the need to tell my friends

322
01:08:01,020 --> 01:08:10,770
Meadows beyond me that's why I was upset

323
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:14,490
she's my best friend can you imagine how

324
01:08:10,770 --> 01:08:18,780
that makes me feel Shelly I battle with

325
01:08:14,490 --> 01:08:21,120
this every day but when she fired off

326
01:08:18,780 --> 01:08:24,480
that when you're ready jab I just I

327
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:29,220
fired back and I didn't think about how

328
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:32,819
would make you feel I'm sorry

329
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:39,830

334
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:24,750

say it

336
01:09:24,750 --> 01:09:31,440
she'll have you going on a blind you

337
01:09:26,610 --> 01:09:35,310

338
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:39,300
I don't know him - I didn't I didn't

01:09:35,310 --> 01:09:42,360
mean to put already she's my boss you

340
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:46,460
know and I learned not to say no to your

341
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:46,460
boss especially she's a woman

342
01:09:49,040 --> 01:10:02,950
I know you care about me I don't doubt

343
01:09:52,549 --> 01:10:02,950
that but are you in love with me sorry

344
01:10:03,210 --> 01:10:10,260
I'm 32 years old and I have no idea how

345
01:10:06,060 --> 01:10:14,010
to answer that I don't even know how

346
01:10:10,260 --> 01:10:17,640
love feels I mean how does someone

347
01:10:14,010 --> 01:10:20,570
decide if they're in love or not if I

348
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:25,020
don't even know what it feels like

349
01:10:20,570 --> 01:10:28,440
well to me love is what you make it it

350
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:32,159
can be defined in so many ways it can be

351
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:36,000
how you feel about a person or or how a

352
01:10:32,159 --> 01:10:39,110
person makes you feel or both that's how

353
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,110
you define love Roger

354
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:47,650
I was ever explained it to him that way

355
01:10:45,060 --> 01:10:51,790
can make sense

356
01:10:47,650 --> 01:10:53,639
so the same love is funding a little

357
01:10:51,790 --> 01:11:00,550
different for everyone

358
01:10:53,639 --> 01:11:04,469
exactly it's what you make it no one's

359
01:11:00,550 --> 01:11:07,530
ever made me feel the way you do and

360
01:11:04,469 --> 01:11:14,230
I've never felt this strongly about

361
01:11:07,530 --> 01:11:19,500
anyone before I guess I've been looking

362
01:11:14,230 --> 01:11:19,500
for directions to a place I learn yeah

363
01:11:21,270 --> 01:11:26,469
what's so funny

364
01:11:23,550 --> 01:11:30,730
no Roger it's not funny

365
01:11:26,469 --> 01:11:32,139
I just never made sense to me how you

366
01:11:30,730 --> 01:11:34,920
never say you love me

367
01:11:32,139 --> 01:11:37,210
and yet you act like a person in love

368
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:40,889
well you're you mean the world to me

369
01:11:37,210 --> 01:11:45,969
Shelly there's no one I want to be with

370
01:11:40,889 --> 01:11:52,510
you what I feel about you've got to be

371
01:11:45,969 --> 01:11:53,180
loved I love you Shelly and I love you

372
01:11:52,510 --> 01:12:37,680

377
01:38:52,039 --> 01:38:57,050
all right I apologize has to be in the

378
01:38:55,219 --> 01:38:59,449
form of the lender but at this point I

379
01:38:57,050 --> 01:39:01,969
think it's best I'm sorry that I never

380
01:38:59,449 --> 01:39:03,710
took her many opportunities to tell you

381
01:39:01,969 --> 01:39:05,630
that I adore you I kept telling myself

382
01:39:03,710 --> 01:39:09,380
to wait for the perfect opportunity to

383
01:39:05,630 --> 01:39:11,150
tell you and well waiting I fell in love

384
01:39:09,380 --> 01:39:12,079
with you now appears that the

385
01:39:11,150 --> 01:39:14,840
opportunity is gone

386
01:39:12,079 --> 01:39:16,880
something beat me to it

387
01:39:14,840 --> 01:39:18,650
I can't begin to tell you how many times

388
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:20,409

394
01:39:30,469 --> 01:39:33,499

399
01:39:52,249 --> 01:39:59,869
