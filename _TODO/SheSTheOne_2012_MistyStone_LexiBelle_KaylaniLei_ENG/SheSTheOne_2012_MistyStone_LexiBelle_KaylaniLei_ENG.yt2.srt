01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:52,410
know especially after your friend tells

308
01:07:48,930 --> 01:07:54,930

311
01:07:57,119 --> 01:08:02,069

01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:24,929
ready jab I just I fired back and I

320
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:29,659

321
01:08:24,929 --> 01:08:29,659
feel I'm sorry

322
01:08:34,389 --> 01:08:37,989

first look Alice loved playing cupid and

328
01:09:23,710 --> 01:09:30,819
once you say yes she'll have you going

329
01:09:25,839 --> 01:09:34,569
on a blind here today I really I really

330
01:09:30,819 --> 01:09:37,469
couldn't say no I know no offense to you

331
01:09:34,569 --> 01:09:41,859
I didn't I didn't mean to funny

332
01:09:37,469 --> 01:09:43,929
she's my boss you know and I learned not

333
01:09:41,859 --> 01:09:51,219
to say no to your boss good especially

334
01:09:43,929 --> 01:09:51,940
if she's a woman I know you care about

335
01:09:51,219 --> 01:09:57,370
me

336
01:09:51,940 --> 01:09:59,760
I don't doubt that but are you in love

337
01:09:57,370 --> 01:09:59,760
with me

338
01:09:59,870 --> 01:10:10,290
so I'm 32 years old and I have no idea

339
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:14,010
how to answer that I don't even know how

340
01:10:10,290 --> 01:10:16,500
love feels I mean how does someone

341
01:10:14,010 --> 01:10:18,989
decide if they're in love

342
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:20,570
or not if I don't even know what it

343
01:10:18,989 --> 01:10:25,080
feels like

344
01:10:20,570 --> 01:10:28,440
well to me love is what you make it it

345
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:32,160
can be defined in so many ways it can be

346
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:35,760
how you feel about a person or or how a

347
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:38,490
person makes you feel or both and that's

348
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:41,070
how you define love Roger

349
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:47,180
I was ever explained it to him that way

350
01:10:45,050 --> 01:10:51,330
kind of makes sense

351
01:10:47,180 --> 01:10:53,660
so you're saying love is something

352
01:10:51,330 --> 01:10:58,250
that's a little different for everyone

353
01:10:53,660 --> 01:10:58,250
exactly it's what you make it

354
01:11:00,090 --> 01:11:07,520
no one ever made me feel the way you do

355
01:11:03,150 --> 01:11:14,220
and I've never felt this strongly about

356
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:22,260
anyone before I guess I've been looking

357
01:11:14,220 --> 01:11:23,570
for directions to a place oh yeah what's

358
01:11:22,260 --> 01:11:26,490
so funny

359
01:11:23,570 --> 01:11:30,720
no Roger it's not funny

360
01:11:26,490 --> 01:11:33,510
I just never made sense to me how you

361
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:36,480
never say you love me and yet you act

362
01:11:33,510 --> 01:11:39,780
like a person in love well you're you

363
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:44,910
mean the world to me Shelly there's no

364
01:11:39,780 --> 01:11:48,990
one I want to be with yeah what I feel

365
01:11:44,910 --> 01:11:54,770
about you gotta be love I love you

366
01:11:48,990 --> 01:11:54,770
Shelly and I love you Roger

367
01:14:38,260 --> 01:14:40,260
Oh

368
01:17:07,449 --> 01:17:09,449
Oh

369
01:19:49,030 --> 01:19:52,930
then he spoke to you

370
01:21:59,460 --> 01:22:12,830
oh my god

371

381
01:38:58,900 --> 01:39:02,530
sorry that I never took her many

382
01:39:00,820 --> 01:39:04,720
opportunities to tell you that I adore

383
01:39:02,530 --> 01:39:06,270
you I kept telling myself to wait for

384
01:39:04,720 --> 01:39:09,640
the perfect opportunity to tell you and

385
01:39:06,270 --> 01:39:11,970
while waiting I fell in love with you

386
01:39:09,640 --> 01:39:14,810
now appears that the opportunity is gone

387
01:39:11,970 --> 01:39:16,910
something beat me to it

388
01:39:14,810 --> 01:39:18,620

01:39:16,910 --> 01:39:20,320

403
01:40:00,820 --> 01:40:05,530
reason that's the reason we're here I

415
01:40:47,929 --> 01:40:56,210
if it don't fit don't force it if I

416
01:40:50,690 --> 01:40:59,870

431
01:42:07,980 --> 01:42:15,840
payer corporations with a merger down

432
01:42:12,450 --> 01:42:20,700
the street from work there was a little

433
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:23,870
diner going there like every day to see

434
01:42:20,700 --> 01:42:23,870
Rachel that's right

435
01:42:31,300 --> 01:42:36,970
it's not every day you run into someone

436
01:42:33,740 --> 01:42:39,470
that makes you feel wonderful

437
01:42:36,970 --> 01:42:42,770

438
01:42:39,470 --> 01:42:44,360

439
01:42:42,770 --> 01:42:47,360
lifetime where you meet that special

440
01:42:44,360 --> 01:42:51,950
someone and if you let those moments go

441
01:42:47,360 --> 01:42:54,740
by they're gone forever so don't take it

01:42:51,950 --> 01:42:56,360
for granted I just felt like a time

443
01:42:54,740 --> 01:42:58,580
would come when it would be perfect for

444
01:42:56,360 --> 01:43:01,130
me to move forward and then I held out

445
01:42:58,580 --> 01:43:03,830
for another perfect time and then

446
01:43:01,130 --> 01:43:05,990
