get this ball rolling and this whole

28
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:36,709
merger thing and have this ten in days

look it just means I don't know if

446
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:45,410
marriage is right for me see that's all

447
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:46,970
you have to say well I didn't think

448
01:07:45,410 --> 01:07:49,070
you'd want to hear it you know

449
01:07:46,970 --> 01:07:53,210
especially after your friend tells you

450
01:07:49,070 --> 01:07:55,520
her proposal story no no honey you've

451
01:07:53,210 --> 01:07:57,770
been nothing but honest to me about how

452
01:07:55,520 --> 01:08:00,620
you feel about marriage and that's tough

453
01:07:57,770 --> 01:08:04,130
enough but why you felt the need to tell

454
01:08:00,620 --> 01:08:10,070
my friend Samantha is beyond me that's

455
01:08:04,130 --> 01:08:13,490
why I was upset she's my best friend you

456
01:08:10,070 --> 01:08:18,290
imagine how that makes me feel Shelly I

457
01:08:13,490 --> 01:08:20,600
battle with this every day but when she

458
01:08:18,290 --> 01:08:23,450
fired off that when you're ready jab I

459
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:28,279
just I fired back and I didn't think

460
01:08:23,450 --> 01:08:33,369
about how would make you feel I'm sorry

462
01:08:34,380 --> 01:08:39,939
do you love me

464
01:08:39,939 --> 01:08:47,409

466
01:08:47,409 --> 01:09:08,290

01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:23,720
yeah so this is my first blind date yes

470
01:09:20,060 --> 01:09:25,850
first look I was loved playing cupid and

471
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:30,800
once you say yes she'll have you going

472
01:09:25,850 --> 01:09:34,550
on a blind date today I really I really

473
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:37,450
couldn't say no I mean no offense to you

474
01:09:34,550 --> 01:09:41,840
I didn't I didn't mean to suhara me

475
01:09:37,450 --> 01:09:44,150
she's my boss you know and I learned not

476
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:51,980
to say no to your boss especially if

477
01:09:44,150 --> 01:09:57,380
she's a woman I know you care about me I

478
01:09:51,980 --> 01:09:59,770
don't doubt that but are you in love

479
01:09:57,380 --> 01:09:59,770
with me

480
01:09:59,849 --> 01:10:10,269
so I'm 32 years old and I have no idea

481
01:10:05,650 --> 01:10:14,019
how to answer that I don't even know how

482
01:10:10,269 --> 01:10:16,510
love feels I mean how does someone

483
01:10:14,019 --> 01:10:18,999
decide if they're in love

484
01:10:16,510 --> 01:10:20,579
or not if I don't even know what it

485
01:10:18,999 --> 01:10:24,610
feels like

486
01:10:20,579 --> 01:10:28,119
well to me love is what you make it

487
01:10:24,610 --> 01:10:31,659
they can be defined in so many ways it

488
01:10:28,119 --> 01:10:35,619
can be how you feel about a person or or

489
01:10:31,659 --> 01:10:38,480
how a person makes you feel or both and

490
01:10:35,619 --> 01:10:41,110
that's how you define love Roger

492
01:10:41,110 --> 01:10:47,160
I was ever explained it to him that way

493
01:10:45,030 --> 01:10:51,190
kind of make sense

494
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:53,640
so you're saying love is something

495
01:10:51,190 --> 01:11:00,490
that's a little different for everyone

496
01:10:53,640 --> 01:11:04,320
exactly it's what you make it I no one

497
01:11:00,490 --> 01:11:07,530
ever made me feel the way you do and

498
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:14,230
I've never felt this strongly about

499
01:11:07,530 --> 01:11:22,330
anyone before I guess I've been looking

500
01:11:14,230 --> 01:11:23,580
for directions to a place yeah what's so

501
01:11:22,330 --> 01:11:26,350
funny

502
01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:30,730
no Roger it's not funny

503
01:11:26,350 --> 01:11:33,520
I just never made sense to me how you

504
01:11:30,730 --> 01:11:36,460
never say you love me and yet you act

505
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:39,790
like a person in love well you're you

506
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:44,650
mean the world to me Shelly there's no

507
01:11:39,790 --> 01:11:49,000
one I want to be with I mean you what I

508
01:11:44,650 --> 01:11:51,030
feel about you gotta be loved I love you

509
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:53,240
Shelly

510
01:11:51,030 --> 01:12:42,969
and I love you Roger

521
01:14:37,830 --> 01:14:39,830
Oh

581
01:38:53,739 --> 01:38:58,880
has to be in the form of the lighter but

582
01:38:56,090 --> 01:39:00,829
at this point I think it's best I'm

583
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:02,540
sorry that I never took her many

584
01:39:00,829 --> 01:39:04,730
opportunities to tell you that I adore

585
01:39:02,540 --> 01:39:06,280
you I kept telling myself to wait for

586
01:39:04,730 --> 01:39:10,340
the perfect opportunity to tell you and

587
01:39:06,280 --> 01:39:11,980
well waiting I fell in love with you it

588
01:39:10,340 --> 01:39:14,870
now appears that the opportunity is gone

589
01:39:11,980 --> 01:39:16,910
someone beat me to it

590
01:39:14,870 --> 01:39:18,620
I can't begin to tell you how many times

01:39:16,910 --> 01:39:20,369

602
01:39:53,609 --> 01:39:59,909

guys

609
01:40:17,809 --> 01:40:24,780
the feeling was mutual and two months

610
01:40:21,629 --> 01:40:27,059
later we split up and we got a divorce

612
01:40:27,059 --> 01:40:38,630
well what is here is really

613
01:40:32,230 --> 01:40:41,660
go ahead no I was like what was was

614
01:40:38,630 --> 01:40:43,790
revealing reason oh I didn't think I

615
01:40:41,660 --> 01:40:47,090
needed a reason although there are

616
01:40:43,790 --> 01:40:50,210
plenty of them I learn to go with my gut

617
01:40:47,090 --> 01:40:56,030
feeling and if it don't fit don't force

618
01:40:50,210 --> 01:41:00,080
it but definitely force that one look if

619
01:40:56,030 --> 01:41:02,920
it will say going just follow her heart

620
01:41:00,080 --> 01:41:07,410

622
01:41:07,410 --> 01:41:17,340

626
01:41:26,280 --> 01:41:32,360
as yours

627
01:41:28,610 --> 01:41:32,360
this is girl Rachel

628
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:44,260
it's never

629
01:41:39,960 --> 01:41:47,099
never worked up the nerve teller

631
01:41:47,099 --> 01:41:51,090
I remember that little situation is

632
01:41:49,400 --> 01:41:55,489
crazy

633
01:41:51,090 --> 01:41:55,489
do tell I like crazy

634
01:41:56,659 --> 01:42:00,280
all right that's so lame

635
01:42:01,400 --> 01:42:08,000
okay about six months ago I was

636
01:42:04,360 --> 01:42:12,530
relocated by la foret de la one of our

637
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:15,860
payer corporations with a merger on the

638
01:42:12,530 --> 01:42:20,540
street from work there was a little

639
01:42:15,860 --> 01:42:23,860
diner I'll go and I liked every day to

640
01:42:20,540 --> 01:42:23,860
see Rachel that's right

642
01:42:31,300 --> 01:42:36,970
it's not every day you run into someone

643
01:42:33,740 --> 01:42:39,470
that makes you feel wonderful

644
01:42:36,970 --> 01:42:42,770
these are rare moments and in special

645
01:42:39,470 --> 01:42:44,360
people there's only a few moments in a

646
01:42:42,770 --> 01:42:47,360
lifetime where you meet that special

647
01:42:44,360 --> 01:42:51,950
someone and if you let those moments go

648
01:42:47,360 --> 01:42:54,920
by they're gone forever so don't take it

649
01:42:51,950 --> 01:42:56,630
for granted I just felt like it Thailand

650
01:42:54,920 --> 01:42:58,610
come when it would be perfect for me to

651
01:42:56,630 --> 01:43:01,400
move forward and then I held out for

652
01:42:58,610 --> 01:43:04,040
another perfect time and then another

653
01:43:01,400 --> 01:43:06,200
and another sweetie now you know there's

654
01:43:04,040 --> 01:43:11,090

655
01:43:06,200 --> 01:43:12,350
whatever you make it what do I do now

656
01:43:11,090 --> 01:43:15,490
and too late

657
01:43:12,350 --> 01:43:23,149
act on your moment now

659
01:43:24,610 --> 01:43:32,390

660
01:43:30,380 --> 01:43:36,010

adventure and taking a chance which you
