anything lose any panties no all present

555
01:06:24,079 --> 01:06:32,270
accounted for did you sniff any of them

556
01:06:28,089 --> 01:06:36,670
uh no but I really like those black

557
01:06:32,270 --> 01:06:36,670
fairly ones on the top there really

558
01:06:39,250 --> 01:06:43,059

561
01:07:05,150 --> 01:07:34,790
my date now or are you hoping for no

562
01:07:25,430 --> 01:07:36,710
panties so let me get this straight

563
01:07:34,790 --> 01:07:39,860
you've never heard a lot of sock theory

564
01:07:36,710 --> 01:07:44,350
I mean it's move in fact a fancy

565
01:07:39,860 --> 01:07:48,020
university did a whole study on it okay

566
01:07:44,350 --> 01:07:51,500
all socks come in pairs right what about

567
01:07:48,020 --> 01:07:53,840
ten packs even those they may start off

568
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:57,980
as ten singles but you know mysteriously

569
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:59,690
unpredictably they end up in pairs and I

570
01:07:57,980 --> 01:08:02,690
mean there's no rhyme or reason no

571
01:07:59,690 --> 01:08:04,810
pre-planned process they just end up in

572
01:08:02,690 --> 01:08:10,250
pairs and stay in pairs

573
01:08:04,810 --> 01:08:12,530
the last sock theory exactly well people

574
01:08:10,250 --> 01:08:14,890
who just like socks they don't think

575
01:08:12,530 --> 01:08:18,980
they found that perfect mate that pair

576
01:08:14,890 --> 01:08:24,970
until the unthinkable happen they break

577
01:08:18,980 --> 01:08:27,740
up but people break up every day yeah

578
01:08:24,970 --> 01:08:31,400
and lots of socks go missing I mean you

579
01:08:27,740 --> 01:08:33,410
know what the statistics there um no but

580
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:35,960
when people break up they have good

581
01:08:33,410 --> 01:08:39,410
reasons I mean it's not like some big

582
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:41,720
cosmic mystery or anything yes sometimes

583
01:08:39,410 --> 01:08:43,970
like sometimes the missing sock simply

584
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:46,460
fell out of the basket but what about

585
01:08:43,970 --> 01:08:48,620
the rest of the time okay nobody reached

586
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:51,380
in the Machine and stolen the dryer

587
01:08:48,620 --> 01:08:55,520
didn't eat it I mean a soft just simply

588
01:08:51,380 --> 01:08:59,210
disappears like the love sometimes love

589
01:08:55,520 --> 01:09:03,609
just disappears there's no notice or

590
01:08:59,210 --> 01:09:03,609
warning to simply God

591
01:09:03,759 --> 01:09:13,750
Wow that's really deep

592
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:16,529
so then the poor lost Lovelace sock just

593
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:19,980
wanders around trying to find its mate

594
01:09:16,529 --> 01:09:22,420
well that's one theory

595
01:09:19,980 --> 01:09:24,190
me personally I think there's a big sock

596
01:09:22,420 --> 01:09:26,230
swinger party that old single socks hang

597
01:09:24,190 --> 01:09:35,080
out at and trying to get lucky you're

598
01:09:26,230 --> 01:09:38,109
good he really was he was cute funny

599
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:42,000
kind of smart but it was more than that

600
01:09:38,109 --> 01:09:58,050
I couldn't quite put my finger on it yet

601
01:09:42,000 --> 01:10:01,480
but there was definitely something as

602
01:09:58,050 --> 01:10:04,450
much as I'd like to invite you in I

603
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:06,690

604
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:06,690

spent talking in the laundry huh

608
01:10:16,330 --> 01:10:24,430
I mean we easily got two maybe three

609
01:10:18,550 --> 01:10:26,110
dates under our belt nice try but no and

610
01:10:24,430 --> 01:10:28,840
