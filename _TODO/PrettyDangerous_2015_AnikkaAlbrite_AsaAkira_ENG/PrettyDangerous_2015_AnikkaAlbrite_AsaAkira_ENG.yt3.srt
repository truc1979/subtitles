there you'll find all the information

556
01:04:59,030 --> 01:05:03,410
about the house and everyone who works

557
01:05:00,829 --> 01:05:04,700

560
01:05:10,190 --> 01:05:14,920

561
01:05:12,740 --> 01:05:17,089
aspiring rapper or some shit

562
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:20,900
seems like her taste in men is as

563
01:05:17,089 --> 01:05:22,130
questionable as our wardrobe yeah and in

564
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:25,220
your folder you will find the

565
01:05:22,130 --> 01:05:27,140

566
01:05:25,220 --> 01:05:30,079

remains of the wicked storm there's a

568
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:35,089
chest and inside you'll find the Ruby

569
01:05:32,750 --> 01:05:36,710
being our underwater expert I figure

570
01:05:35,089 --> 01:05:38,020
