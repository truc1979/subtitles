take some dictation please dear board

126
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:42,490
members it has come to my attention that

127
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:45,730
certain members of this organization

128
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:49,060
do not feel that the proper course is

129
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:52,780
the one I've outlined so I have decided

130
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:56,610
to pursue my stock options to buy out

131
00:16:52,780 --> 00:17:03,720
the existing shares and to conduct a

132
00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:07,329
hostile takeover my decision to do this

133
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:14,170
has not only been prompted by the

134
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:21,480
situation in the boardroom last week but

135
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:26,770
also by the confusion about last month's

136
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:32,290
inventory but what was that last bit the

137
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:34,960
last month's inventory it has also come

138
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:39,370
to my attention of the quarterly

139
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:46,510
adjustments should be taken in full

140
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:51,110
context and not individually as outlined

141
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:52,830
by policies and procedures

143
00:17:52,830 --> 00:18:04,339
furthermore aha I would like to conclude

149
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:26,410
yeah yeah

151
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,730

651
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:49,560
first up everyone's doing an excellent

652
01:24:47,910 --> 01:24:52,590
job I just wanted to say that first and

653
01:24:49,560 --> 01:24:55,470
foremost this is a very special week

654
01:24:52,590 --> 01:24:58,410
it's sweeps week and that means that the

655
01:24:55,470 --> 01:25:00,660
network needs us to do a live episode as

656
01:24:58,410 --> 01:25:03,450
if there's not enough pressure on each

657
01:25:00,660 --> 01:25:06,300
and every one of us so when we go back

658
01:25:03,450 --> 01:25:07,920
it's going to be all live so we can't

659
01:25:06,300 --> 01:25:11,220
have any fuck-ups

660
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:15,810
that means remember your lines remember

661
01:25:11,220 --> 01:25:17,850
your positions and remember your

662
01:25:15,810 --> 01:25:20,430
positions so I'm gonna do a countdown

663
01:25:17,850 --> 01:25:28,470
from five and then everyone's gonna

664
01:25:20,430 --> 01:25:29,640
start so here we go five four damn it as

665
01:25:28,470 --> 01:25:33,210
your friend and doctor

666
01:25:29,640 --> 01:25:35,100
I advise strongly against it look you

667
01:25:33,210 --> 01:25:37,650
don't think I know that I have the rare

668
01:25:35,100 --> 01:25:41,340
disease tickle sick gnosis and then it

669
01:25:37,650 --> 01:25:46,740
only affects 190 million and that I

670
01:25:41,340 --> 01:25:50,010
happen to be that one and I know that my

671
01:25:46,740 --> 01:25:55,410
odds are that I'm going to die but if I

672
01:25:50,010 --> 01:26:02,430
still have a chance then I choose life

673
01:25:55,410 --> 01:26:06,150

674
01:26:02,430 --> 01:26:31,110
