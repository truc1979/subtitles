dear board members this come to my

154
00:16:39,129 --> 00:16:45,220
attention that certain members of this

155
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:48,609
organization do not feel that the proper

156
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:51,569
course is the one I've outlined so I've

157
00:16:48,609 --> 00:16:55,449
decided to pursue my stock options to

158
00:16:51,569 --> 00:17:01,809
buy out the existing shares and to

159
00:16:55,449 --> 00:17:06,329
conduct a hostile takeover my decision

160
00:17:01,809 --> 00:17:11,500
to do this has not only been prompted by

161
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:18,610
the situation in the board room last

162
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:24,429
week but also by the confusion about

163
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:30,570
last month's inventory that's what was

164
00:17:24,429 --> 00:17:33,960
that lasted the last month's inventory

165
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:39,039
it has also come to my attention the

166
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:45,909
quarterly adjustments should be taken in

167
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:52,289
full context and not individually as

168
00:17:45,909 --> 00:17:52,289
outlined by policies and procedures

169
00:17:52,820 --> 00:18:01,170
furthermore aha

170
00:17:55,769 --> 00:18:11,900

176
00:18:54,010 --> 00:19:04,650
