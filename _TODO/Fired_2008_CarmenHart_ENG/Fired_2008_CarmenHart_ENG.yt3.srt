please dear board members it has come to

140
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:42,480
my attention that certain members of

141
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:45,720
this organization

142
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:48,810
do not feel that the proper course is

143
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:52,800
the one I've out wanted so I've decided

144
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:56,600
to pursue my stock options to buy out

145
00:16:52,800 --> 00:17:03,650
the existing shares and to conduct a

146
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:07,319
hostile takeover my decision to do this

147
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:14,160
has not only been prompted by the

148
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:19,940
situation in the boardroom last week but

149
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:21,470
also by the confusion about last month's

151
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:32,310
inventory but what was that last bet the

152
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:34,890
last month's inventory it has also come

153
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:39,360
to my attention of the quarterly

154
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:47,990
adjustments should be taken in full

155
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:52,280
context and not individually as outlined

156
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:52,280
by policies and procedures

157
00:17:52,820 --> 00:18:02,659
furthermore aha

158
00:17:55,860 --> 00:18:02,659
I would like to conclude

159
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:26,720
ah

166
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:26,410

729
01:24:45,020 --> 01:24:49,110
attention first up everyone's doing an

730
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:51,750
excellent job I just wanted to say that

731
01:24:49,110 --> 01:24:54,930
first and foremost this is a very

732
01:24:51,750 --> 01:24:56,880
special week it's sweeps week and that

733
01:24:54,930 --> 01:24:59,490
means that the network needs us to do a

734
01:24:56,880 --> 01:25:02,310
live episode as if there's not enough

735
01:24:59,490 --> 01:25:05,220
pressure on each and every one of us so

736
01:25:02,310 --> 01:25:07,770
when we go back it's going to be all

737
01:25:05,220 --> 01:25:11,220
live so we can have any fuck-ups

738
01:25:07,770 --> 01:25:15,810
that means remember your lines remember

739
01:25:11,220 --> 01:25:17,850
your positions and remember your

740
01:25:15,810 --> 01:25:20,400
positions so I'm gonna do a countdown

741
01:25:17,850 --> 01:25:28,410
from five and then everyone's gonna

742
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:30,210
start so here we go five four damn it

743
01:25:28,410 --> 01:25:33,480
as your friend and doctor I advise

744
01:25:30,210 --> 01:25:35,640
strongly against it look you don't think

745
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:37,800
I know that I have the rare disease

746
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:41,970
tickle sick gnosis and then it only

747
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:47,460
affects 190 million and that I happen to

748
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:50,250
be that one and I know that my odds are

749
01:25:47,460 --> 01:25:55,480
that I'm going to die but if I still

750
01:25:50,250 --> 01:26:02,440
have a chance then I choose life

751
01:25:55,480 --> 01:26:29,230
choose life I choose life life is what I

752
01:26:02,440 --> 01:26:31,570
choose can that can I get you a couple

753
01:26:29,230 --> 01:26:33,850
please go to the space set and that's

754
01:26:31,570 --> 01:26:36,070
for youth space does not exist there's
