00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:44,109
Jackson this is his place and I can't

4
00:02:42,939 --> 00:02:48,219
believe it's actually been a year since

5
00:02:44,109 --> 00:02:52,540
Oh God you know free back a lot of

6
00:02:48,219 --> 00:02:55,299
memories place excuse me creep

7
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:57,189
I just find it strange that the executor

8
00:02:55,299 --> 00:02:59,349
of the estate sent you a letter from

9
00:02:57,189 --> 00:03:01,439
your grandfather a year after he died

10
00:02:59,349 --> 00:03:06,730
that can only be open in his house

11
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:12,489
nevertheless the grave cookie I say we

12
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:14,290
don't stay here I mean it's what makes

13
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:15,609
me feel like a kid again well you should

14
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:18,519
we go through the weather bed all right

15
00:03:15,609 --> 00:03:22,120
knucklehead we make us a quick visit

16
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:25,840
okay okay there he is

17
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:28,060
my grandpa jebediah Jackson why he was

18
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,230
the greatest storyteller ever I mean he

19
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:31,780
could tell you about historical bits

20
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:37,840
just like he was actually there he's the

21
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:40,900
greatest is this him - I know no that

22
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,759
was his grandpa general Jeff Jackson he

23
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:45,069
rode with robert e lee with old Virginny

24
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:46,750
yeah back in the old war you know with

25
00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:48,909
the southern independence yeah

26
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:50,949
why grandpa used to tell me that he had

27
00:03:48,909 --> 00:03:52,449
quite a reputation about why when he

28
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:53,709
would go on to the battlefield the

29
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:54,579
Yankees would take one look at him and

30
00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:57,310
turn tail and run

31
00:03:54,579 --> 00:04:00,250
oh yeah he was great and of course after

32
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:01,930
the war is quite an engine fighter he

33
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:06,220
names would see him and shaking their

34
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:07,530
moccasins mm-hmm see the family

35
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:11,349
resemblance

36
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:13,930
you know it's weird you feel Azizi top

37
00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:14,519
looks and these guys look exactly the

38
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:18,669
same

39
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:20,799
yeah you know you're right but other

40
00:04:18,669 --> 00:04:22,719
than that similarities with their looks

41
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:25,389
that's all if they had in common I mean

42
00:04:22,719 --> 00:04:28,180
great grandpa why he was a great war

43
00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:30,009
hero and an Injun fighter in grandpa

44
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:32,460
here well he was a scientist and an

45
00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:35,949
inventor what an eccentric one at that

46
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:38,500
what happened to you hey being a

47
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:41,660
chiropractor is a noble occupation why I

48
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:42,980
why I aligned may important people

49
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:45,170
what you know what they say if you're

50
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:46,760
not properly aligned don't you know but

51
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:48,350
I'm sure you're about to tell me well

52
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:51,320
your tires go bald your rear end chicks

53
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:52,850
but enough about that tell you what why

54
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,300
don't I take you to the most important

55
00:04:52,850 --> 00:05:03,770
room

56
00:04:53,300 --> 00:05:07,730
grandpa's lavatory Wow with all its

57
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:09,380
stuff what is he working on I don't know

58
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:11,450
I mean he's real secretive about his

59
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:12,140
last project didn't want it to fall in

60
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:14,060
the wrong hand

61
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:17,360
something about commie spies being

62
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:21,170
everywhere what a good I guess I'm sandy

63
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:23,510
it's the red fairy could be too much

64
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:26,980
chlorine in the gene pool how do you

65
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:26,980
open that letter seems appalling here

67
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:39,320
Randall if you're reading this that it

68
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,670
means that your old grandpa's gone I

69
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,500
have something to tell you that you're

70
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:45,620
going to find hard to understand this

71
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,960
thing's our story that I told you when

72
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:51,050
you were a kid were not passed down

73
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,580
actually lived them that's right I was

74
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:55,640
the ancestor that was in King Arthur's

75
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:58,910
Court I crossed the ocean with Columbus

76
00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:01,250
bought the revolution and yes the truth

77
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:03,590
is the truth is now is also the old

78
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:05,419
general an Indian fighter your real

79
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:06,169
ancestors were nothing but bootleggers

80
00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:07,970
and horse thieves

81
00:06:06,169 --> 00:06:10,300
so I single-handedly had given you a

82
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:12,560
family tree that you could be proud of

83
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:15,350
what size straightjacket did you say

84
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,520
your grandfather wore Risha I've

85
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:20,050
invented a time machine

86
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:22,430
a time machine yes a time machine

87
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:24,830
Einstein's theory states time is not

88
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:26,360
consistent but flexible with this

89
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:27,980
machine there is no longer any

90
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,890
distinction between three-dimensional

91
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:33,980
time and space I have proven that they

92
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:38,240
are fused in a four-dimensional time and

93
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:40,790
space continuum of course I just it just

94
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,060
makes perfectly good sense and that's

95
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:48,260
why I went to college I should move this

96
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:51,650
perfect sense you have heard of the

97
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:54,080
fourth dimension no now the fifth

98
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:55,289
dimension I've heard of you know the age

99
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,809
of

100
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:59,999
damnit this is serious I mean just

101
00:06:57,809 --> 00:07:02,969
imagine that you could be transported

102
00:06:59,999 --> 00:07:05,759
into the past or into the future I mean

103
00:07:02,969 --> 00:07:08,490
not just incredible wait there's more

104
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:13,080
okay you'll find the time machine hidden

105
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:15,059
under a drop cloth here in the lab okay

106
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,930
here the instructions use this machine

107
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:19,610
wisely

108
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:35,689
face dire consequences Oh higher

109
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:39,839
consequences haha is this proof enough

110
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:41,639
this this is your proof this only proves

111
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:43,800
