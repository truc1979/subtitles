2
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,790
Well... This is it:

3
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,500
My grandfather

4
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,850
Jebediah Jackson

5
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:41,990
This is his place

6
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,760
And I can't believe it's actually
been a year since...

7
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:48,210
Since he's gone.

8
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,420
You know it brings back a lot of
memories to be in this place

9
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:52,500
This place, excuse me, it creeps

10
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:55,200
Don't you find it strange that the executor

11
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,150
of the estate sent you a letter from your

12
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,600
grandfather a year after he died, that

13
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,330
can only be opened in his house?

14
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,800
*** letter from the grave

15
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,739
That's spooky

16
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:07,201

17
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,941

the greatest storyteller ever I mean he

26
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,209
could tell you about historical bits

27
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,760
just like he was actually there he's the

28
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:37,820

34
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:50,930
quite a reputation about why when he

35
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,430
would go on to the battlefield the

36
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,690
Yankees would take one look at him and

37
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:54,560
turn tail and run

38
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,290

something to tell you that you're going

75
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,770
to find hard to understand this thing's

76
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:45,710
our story that I told you when you were

77
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:47,930
a kid were not passed down actually

78
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,780
lived them that's right

79
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,430
I was the ancestor that was in King

80
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:55,130
Arthur's Court I crossed the ocean with

81
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:58,400
Columbus bought the revolution and yes

82
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,860
the truth is the truth is now is also

83
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,380
the old general an Indian fighter your

84
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,790
real ancestors were nothing but

85
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:06,140
bootleggers and horse thieves

86
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,940
so I single-handedly had given you a

87
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,300
family tree that you could be proud of

88
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,560
what size straightjacket did you say

89
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,110
your grandfather wore a sham I've

90
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,640
invented a time machine

91
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:20,050
a time machine yes a time machine

92
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:22,400
Einstein's theory states time is not

93
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,800
consistent but flexible with this

94
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,330
machine there is no longer any

95
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:27,950
distinction between three-dimensional

96
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:30,860
time and space I have proven that they

97
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:33,950
are fused in a four-dimensional time and

98
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:38,240
space continuum of course I just it just

99
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,760
makes perfectly good sense and that's

100
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,030
why I went to college I should know this

101
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:48,230
perfect sense you have heard of the

102
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:51,620
fourth dimension no now the fifth

103
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,050
dimension I've heard of you know the age

104
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:55,250
of

105
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,780
damnit this is serious I mean just

106
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,970
imagine that you could be transported

107
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:03,060
into the past or into the future I'm not

108
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,040
just incredible

109
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:07,320

110
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,180
time machine hidden under a drop cloth

here in the lab okay here the

112
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,720
instructions use this machine wisely

113
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,580
face dire consequences Oh higher

114
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:33,920

why we can't find my grandfather is

because basically you cannot duplicate

00:50:10,539 --> 00:50:11,829
I'm fine what the hell does that mean

487
00:50:11,829 --> 00:50:13,839
what that means is that the time machine

488
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:15,519
cannot be in the same place at the same

489
00:50:15,519 --> 00:50:18,640
time twice oh well that clears it up
