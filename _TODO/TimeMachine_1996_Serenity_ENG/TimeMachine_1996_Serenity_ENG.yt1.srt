00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:55,310
of memories place excuse me Crete would

6
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:57,320

00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:59,360
the estate sent you a letter from your

8
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:01,430
grandfather a year after he died that

9
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:06,590

10
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:11,570

the greatest storyteller ever I mean he

18
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,760
could tell you about historical bits

19
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:37,820
just like he was actually there he's the

20
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:40,880
greatest is this him - I know no that

21
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:42,680

grandpa used to tell me that he had

26
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:52,430
quite a reputation about why when he

27
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,690
would go on to the battlefield the

28
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:54,560
Yankees would take one look at him and

29
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:57,290
turn tail and run

30
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:00,230

last project didn't want it to fall in

58
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:14,030
the wrong hand

59
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:16,880

65
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:40,760
that your old grandpa's gone I have

66
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,770
something to tell you that you're going

67
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:45,710
to find hard to understand this thing's

68
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:47,930
our story that I told you when you were

69
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:50,780
a kid were not passed down actually

70
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:52,430
lived them that's right

71
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:55,130
I was the ancestor that was in King

72
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:58,400
Arthur's Court I crossed the ocean with

73
00:05:55,130 --> 00:06:00,860
Columbus bought the revolution and yes

74
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,380
the truth is the truth is now is also

75
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,790
the old general an Indian fighter your

76
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:06,140
real ancestors were nothing but

77
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:07,940
bootleggers and horse thieves

78
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:10,300
so I single-handedly had given you a

79
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:12,560
family tree that you could be proud of

80
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:15,110
what size straightjacket did you say

81
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,640
your grandfather wore a sham I've

82
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:20,050
invented a time machine

83
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:22,400
a time machine yes a time machine

84
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:24,800
Einstein's theory states time is not

85
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,330
consistent but flexible with this

86
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,950
machine there is no longer any

87
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:30,860
distinction between three-dimensional

88
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:33,950
time and space I have proven that they

89
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:38,240
are fused in a four-dimensional time and

90
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:40,760
space continuum of course I just it just

91
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,030
makes perfectly good sense and that's

92
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:48,230
why I went to college I should know this

93
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:51,620
perfect sense you have heard of the

94
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:54,050
fourth dimension no now the fifth

95
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:55,250
dimension I've heard of you know the age

96
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:57,780
of

97
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:59,970
damnit this is serious I mean just

98
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:03,060
imagine that you could be transported

99
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:04,040
into the past or into the future I'm not

100
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:07,320
just incredible

101
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:09,180
wait there's me okay you'll find the

102
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:13,620
time machine hidden under a drop cloth

103
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:15,720
here in the lab okay here the

104
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:19,580
instructions use this machine wisely

105
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:33,920
face dire consequences Oh higher

106
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:38,220

00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:42,549
there's three of you yeah I'm the one in

471
00:49:42,069 --> 00:49:45,519
the middle

472
00:49:42,549 --> 00:49:59,410
Oh have your two friends let's get out

473
00:49:45,519 --> 00:50:01,450
of here what now genius okay I got this

474
00:49:59,410 --> 00:50:03,519
thing off to get out there the reason

475
00:50:01,450 --> 00:50:06,670
why we can't find my grandfather is

476
00:50:03,519 --> 00:50:10,539
because basically you cannot duplicate

477
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:11,829
the same time space continuum brilliant

478
00:50:10,539 --> 00:50:13,839
I'm fine what the hell does that mean

479
00:50:11,829 --> 00:50:15,519
what that means is that the time machine

480
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:18,640
cannot be in the same place at the same

481
00:50:15,519 --> 00:50:20,170
time twice oh well that clears it up

482

01:12:20,380 --> 01:12:25,750
necessary to have intercourse with earth

764
01:12:22,510 --> 01:12:30,699

01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:57,880
essentially party organisms and will

776
01:12:55,960 --> 01:13:01,030
