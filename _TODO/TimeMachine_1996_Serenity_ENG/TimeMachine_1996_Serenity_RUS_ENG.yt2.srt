21
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,230
was the greatest storyteller ever I mean

22
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:34,780
he could tell you about historical myths

23
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:39,070
just like he was actually there is this

24
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:41,590
him - I know no that was his grandpa

25
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:44,020
General Jeb Jackson he rode with robert

independence yeah why grandpa used to

29
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,550
tell me that he had quite a reputation

30
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,230
about it why would he would go on to the

31
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:54,760
battlefield the Yankees would take one

32
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:56,230
look at him and turn tail and run oh

33
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,540
yeah it was great

34
00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:00,790
and of course after the war he was quite

35
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:05,740
an engine fighter you names would see

36
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:08,740
him shaking their moccasins mm-hmm see

37
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:09,300
the family resemblance you know it's

38
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:13,360
weird

39
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:14,550
it really ZZ Top look these guys look

40
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,640
exactly the same

41
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:20,799
yeah you know you're right but other

42
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:22,540
than that similarities with their looks

43
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:25,360
that's all if they had in common I mean

44
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:28,180
great grandpa why he was a great war

45
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,980
hero and an engine fighter in grandpa

46
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:32,460
here well he was a scientist and an

47
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:35,950
inventor what an eccentric one at that

48
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:38,470
what happened to you hey being a

49
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:41,770
chiropractor is a noble occupation why I

50
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:43,090
why I aligned may important people what

51
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:45,280
you know what they say if you're not

52
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:45,849
properly aligned don't you know but I'm

53
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,679
sure

54
00:04:45,849 --> 00:04:48,999
tell me where your tires go bald and

55
00:04:47,679 --> 00:04:50,889
your rear end shakes but enough about

56
00:04:48,999 --> 00:04:52,270
that

57
00:04:50,889 --> 00:05:02,459
why don't I take you to the most

58
00:04:52,270 --> 00:05:04,599
important room grandpa's laboratory Wow

59
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:07,959
look at all this stuff

60
00:05:04,599 --> 00:05:09,399
what was he working on I don't know I

61
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:11,439
mean he was real secretive about his

62
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:12,249
last project didn't wanted to fall in

63
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:14,080
the wrong hands

64
00:05:12,249 --> 00:05:15,969
something about commie spies being

65
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:20,860
everywhere

66
00:05:15,969 --> 00:05:23,379
I guess insanity is hereditary could be

67
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:36,519
too much chlorine in the gene pool there

68
00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:37,899
you open that letter see here Randall if

69
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:40,089
you're reading this that it means that

70
00:05:37,899 --> 00:05:41,259
your old grandpa's gone I have something

71
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:45,009
to tell you that you're gonna find hard

72
00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:46,330
to understand these things are stories

73
00:05:45,009 --> 00:05:49,379
that I told you when you were a kid were

74
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:51,999
not passed down I actually lived them

75
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:54,639
that's right I was the ancestor that was

76
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:56,619
in King Arthur's Court I crossed the

77
00:05:54,639 --> 00:06:00,159
ocean with Columbus bought the

78
00:05:56,619 --> 00:06:01,719
revolution and yes the truth is the

79
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:04,389
truth is now is also the old general an

80
00:06:01,719 --> 00:06:05,769
Indian fighter your real ancestors were

81
00:06:04,389 --> 00:06:06,249
nothing but bootleggers and horse

82
00:06:05,769 --> 00:06:07,959
thieves

83
00:06:06,249 --> 00:06:10,319
so I single-handedly had given you a

84
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:12,579
family tree that you could be proud of

85
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,439
what size straightjacket did you say

86
00:06:12,579 --> 00:06:16,689
your grandfather wore which we shall

87
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:20,069
I've invented a time machine

88
00:06:16,689 --> 00:06:22,419
a time machine yes a time machine

89
00:06:20,069 --> 00:06:24,819
Einstein's theory states time is not

90
00:06:22,419 --> 00:06:26,349
consistent but flexible with this

91
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:27,969
machine there is no longer any

92
00:06:26,349 --> 00:06:30,879
distinction between three-dimensional

93
00:06:27,969 --> 00:06:33,969
time and space I have proven that they

94
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:38,439
are fused in a four-dimensional time and

95
00:06:33,969 --> 00:06:40,839
space continuum of course I just it just

96
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:43,050
makes perfectly good sense I mean that's

97
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:48,249
why I went to college I should know this

98
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:51,639
perfect sense you have heard of the

99
00:06:48,249 --> 00:06:54,099
fourth dimension no now the fifth

100
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:55,629
dimension I've heard of you know the Age

101
00:06:54,099 --> 00:06:57,789
of Aquarius

102
00:06:55,629 --> 00:06:59,270
damn it this is serious I mean just

103
00:06:57,789 --> 00:07:01,820
imagine the queue

104
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:05,060
be transported into the past or into the

105
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:07,580
future every not just incredible wait

106
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:09,620
there's more okay you'll find a time

107
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:14,210
machine hidden under a drop cloth here

108
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:17,000
in the lab okay here the instructions

109
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:36,970

110
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:40,130
consequences is this proof enough this

111
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:41,630
this is your proof this only proves you

112
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:43,790

113
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:45,620

00:50:11,230 --> 00:50:14,350
hell does that mean what that means is

435
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:16,780
is that the time machine cannot be in

the lights you were involuntarily

647
01:11:38,699 --> 01:11:44,840
consumed by was a neutralizing beam but

648
01:11:42,030 --> 01:11:50,190

649
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:53,789

01:11:56,039 --> 01:12:04,940
galaxy destination is our home planet Z

653
01:11:59,639 --> 01:12:04,940
Borg a planet your kind calls pollute oh

654
01:12:07,159 --> 01:12:13,489
it's not the size of your planet that

655
01:12:09,749 --> 01:12:13,489
counts it's how you use it

656
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:21,690
sadly I do not possess the proper sexual

657
01:12:19,949 --> 01:12:24,479
organs necessary to have intercourse

658
01:12:21,690 --> 01:12:27,619
with earth creatures when this was

659
01:12:24,479 --> 01:12:31,979
revealed imagine my disappointment oh

660
01:12:27,619 --> 01:12:34,019
yeah I know how you felt it's like the

661
01:12:31,979 --> 01:12:35,639
time I found out that Kermit the Frog

662
01:12:34,019 --> 01:12:39,840
was nothing but a big piece of folks

663
01:12:35,639 --> 01:12:42,869
mishandled what do you have to do that

664
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:48,090
it is merely a rectal probe I am an

665
01:12:42,869 --> 01:12:50,070
alien it is what we do excellent you

666
01:12:48,090 --> 01:12:51,329
will be sufficient for my experiment

667
01:12:50,070 --> 01:12:53,489
spare me

668
01:12:51,329 --> 01:12:55,979
my theory is female humans are

669
01:12:53,489 --> 01:12:57,900
essentially party organisms and will

670
01:12:55,979 --> 01:13:01,079
have intercourse with the same sex of

671
01:12:57,900 --> 01:13:04,739
their or similar species at will

672
01:13:01,079 --> 01:13:07,309
I shall observe and what makes you think

673
01:13:04,739 --> 01:13:12,840
I'm gonna cooperate with this peep show

674
01:13:07,309 --> 01:13:15,630
you see this device stupid until it

675
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:19,739
human this is not merely a lamp but the

676
01:13:15,630 --> 01:13:21,539
uranium q-36 space modulator it has the

677
01:13:19,739 --> 01:13:24,780
explosive power to destroy the entire

678
01:13:21,539 --> 01:13:26,760
planet Earth cooperate with us or it

679
