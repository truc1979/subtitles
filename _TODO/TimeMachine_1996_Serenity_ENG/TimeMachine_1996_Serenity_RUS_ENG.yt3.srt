00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:59,110
executor of the estate sent you a letter

8
00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:01,170

00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:04,440
dies that can only be open in this house

spooky I say we don't stay here I mean

12
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,600
this place what makes me feel like a kid

13
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:15,040
again

14
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,860

here he is

18
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:28,090
my grandpa jebediah Jackson why he was

19
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,230
the greatest storyteller ever I mean he

20
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:34,750
could tell you about historical myths

21
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:39,070
just like he was actually there is this

22
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:41,590
him - I know no not with his grandpa

23
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:44,020
General Jeb Jackson he rode with robert

00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:45,459
e lee with the old Virginny yeah back in

25
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:47,020
the old war you know with the Saturday

26
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:48,910
independence yeah

27
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:50,950
why grandpa used to tell me that he had

28
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:52,450
quite a reputation about why when he

29
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:53,709
would go onto the battlefield the

30
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:56,050
Yankees would take one look at him and

31
00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:58,540
turn tail and run oh yeah he was great

32
00:03:56,050 --> 00:04:00,790
and of course after the war he was quite

33
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:05,220
an engine fighter you names would see

34
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:07,530
him shaking their moccasins mm-hmm

35
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:11,350
family resemblance

36
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:14,550
you know it's weird it really ZZ Top

37
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:18,669
look these guys look exactly the same

38
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:20,799
yeah you know you're right but other

39
00:04:18,669 --> 00:04:22,720
than that similarities with their looks

40
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:25,360
that's all if they had in common I mean

41
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:28,180
great grandpa why he was a great war

42
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,980
hero and an Injun fighter in grandpa

43
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:32,430
here well he was a scientist and an

44
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:35,950
inventor or an eccentric one at that

45
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:38,470
what happened to you hey being a

46
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:41,770
chiropractor is a noble occupation why I

47
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:43,030
why I aligned may important people what

48
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:45,280
you know what they say if you're not

49
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:45,849
properly aligned don't you know but I'm

50
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,589
sure

51
00:04:45,849 --> 00:04:48,999

52
00:04:47,589 --> 00:04:51,819

laboratory Wow look at all this stuff

56
00:05:04,599 --> 00:05:09,610
what was he working on I don't know I

57
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:11,499
mean he's real secretive about his last

58
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,249
project didn't want it to fall in the

59
00:05:11,499 --> 00:05:14,080
wrong hands

60
00:05:12,249 --> 00:05:17,800
something about commie spies being

61
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:22,119
everywhere I guess in Sandhya's for rent

62
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:24,069
ferry could be too much chlorine in the

63
00:05:22,119 --> 00:05:36,939
gene pool there you open that letter

64
00:05:24,069 --> 00:05:38,259
sweetie here Randall if you're reading

65
00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:40,119
this that it means that your old

66
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:41,319
grandpa's gone and I have something to

67
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:45,129
tell you that you're gonna find hard to

68
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:46,479
understand these things are stories that

69
00:05:45,129 --> 00:05:50,379
I told you when you were a kid were not

70
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:52,209
passed down I actually lived them that's

71
00:05:50,379 --> 00:05:54,999
right I was the ancestor that was in

72
00:05:52,209 --> 00:05:58,089
King Arthur's Court I crossed the ocean

73
00:05:54,999 --> 00:06:00,999
with Columbus bought the revolution and

74
00:05:58,089 --> 00:06:03,399
yes the truth is the truth is I was also

75
00:06:00,999 --> 00:06:04,809
the old general an Indian fighter your

76
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:06,249
real ancestors were nothing but

77
00:06:04,809 --> 00:06:07,959
bootleggers and horse thieves

78
00:06:06,249 --> 00:06:10,349
so I single-handedly had given you a

79
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:12,579
family tree that you could be proud of

80
00:06:10,349 --> 00:06:14,439
what size straightjacket did you say

81
00:06:12,579 --> 00:06:16,689
your grandfather wore which we shall

82
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:20,069
I've invented a time machine

83
00:06:16,689 --> 00:06:22,389
a time machine yes a time machine

84
00:06:20,069 --> 00:06:24,819
Einstein's theory states time is not

85
00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:26,349
consistent but flexible with this

86
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:27,969
machine there is no longer any

87
00:06:26,349 --> 00:06:30,879
distinction between three-dimensional

88
00:06:27,969 --> 00:06:33,969
time and space I have proven that they

89
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:38,439
are fused in a four-dimensional time and

90
00:06:33,969 --> 00:06:40,839
space continuum of course I just it just

91
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:43,050
makes perfectly good sense I mean that's

92
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:48,249
why I went to college I should know this

93
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:51,639
perfect sense you have heard of the

94
00:06:48,249 --> 00:06:54,069
fourth dimension no now the fifth

95
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:57,159
dimension I've heard of you know the Age

96
00:06:54,069 --> 00:06:59,270
of Aquarius damn it this is serious I

97
00:06:57,159 --> 00:07:01,850
mean just imagine the queue

98
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:04,060
be transported into the past or into the

99
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:07,340
future I mean that's just incredible

100
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:09,200
wait there's more okay you'll find the

101
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:13,640
time machine hidden under a drop cloth

102
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:15,740
here in the lab okay here the

103
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:35,150
instructions use this machine wisely

104
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:38,630
face dire consequences haha is this

105
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:40,610
proof enough this this is your proof

106
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:43,400
this only proves you had a crackpot

107
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:43,790
inventor for a grandfather so can we go

00:50:01,570 --> 00:50:07,060
we can't find my grandfather is because

430
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:11,020
basically you cannot duplicate the same

431
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:12,160
time space continuum really an Einstein

432
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:14,110
what the hell does that mean what that

433
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:15,730
means is is that the time machine cannot

434
00:50:14,110 --> 00:50:19,240
be in the same place at the same time

435
00:50:15,730 --> 00:50:20,380

planet Zee Borg a planet your kind calls

681
01:12:02,079 --> 01:12:13,709
Pluto it's not the size of your planet

682
01:12:09,489 --> 01:12:13,709
that counts it's how you use it

683
01:12:16,769 --> 01:12:21,699
sadly I do not possess the proper sexual

684
01:12:19,929 --> 01:12:24,489
organs necessary to have intercourse

685
01:12:21,699 --> 01:12:27,630
with earth creatures when this was

686
01:12:24,489 --> 01:12:31,989

688
01:12:31,989 --> 01:12:35,650
time I found out that Kermit the Frog is

01:12:34,059 --> 01:12:40,659
nothing but a big piece of folks

690
01:12:35,650 --> 01:12:42,999
mishandles but do you have to do that it

691
01:12:40,659 --> 01:12:47,889
is merely a rectal probe I am an alien

692
01:12:42,999 --> 01:12:50,079

693
01:12:47,889 --> 01:12:53,469
you will be sufficient for my experiment

694
01:12:50,079 --> 01:12:55,989
spare me my theory is female humans are

695
01:12:53,469 --> 01:12:57,909
essentially party organisms and will

696
01:12:55,989 --> 01:13:01,059
have intercourse with the same sex of

697
