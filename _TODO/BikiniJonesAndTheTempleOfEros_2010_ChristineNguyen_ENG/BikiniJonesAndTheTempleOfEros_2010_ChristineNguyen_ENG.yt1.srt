highly poisonous and very pissed-off

166
00:19:31,049 --> 00:19:36,179

00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:38,249
lot and I've got the bruises to prove it

168
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:43,009
a person who leaves a dangerous life

anything that's happened of course I do

226
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:05,850
I took a shower got to know Carol a

227
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:07,380
little better and then I found this

228
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:10,320
strange guy in my house and he was

229
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:13,710
stealing the idol yes yes I had the

230
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:15,299
upper hand and then he told me that he

231
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:18,779
Billa Cruella what to be Empress of

232
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:21,990
moronica she comes from a long line of

233
00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:24,630
morons from Hoboken so I'm told

234
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:26,909
yeah that's what I thought too but the

235
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:29,789
bottom line is whoever finds a tear of

236
00:28:26,909 --> 00:28:34,549
Aisha can crown themselves Empress it's

237
00:28:29,789 --> 00:28:38,269

238
00:28:34,549 --> 00:28:42,889
what about Carol God when I woke up

239
00:28:38,269 --> 00:28:46,889
maybe she split maybe she got kidnapped

240

device in the base of the idol really I

311
00:42:56,340 --> 00:43:01,860
know that well I did but my tracking

312
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:02,970
device is on the blank and I can't seem

313
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:07,410
to get it to work

314
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:11,370

00:43:48,329 --> 00:43:52,109
part for your CIA boy toy games I got a

323
00:43:50,369 --> 00:43:53,789
lot of work to do here that's why I'm

324
00:43:52,109 --> 00:43:55,019
here Martin thought that I can work the

325
00:43:53,789 --> 00:43:59,880
bugs out of your tracking device

326
00:43:55,019 --> 00:44:04,950
knock yourself out ah what seems to be

327
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:09,059
the trouble it's not working I got that

328
00:44:04,950 --> 00:44:10,529
much did you drop it or well yeah from

329
00:44:09,059 --> 00:44:13,680
about 50 feet up in the air

330
00:44:10,529 --> 00:44:16,170
that sounds pretty reckless even from

331
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:18,239
you well when you're hanging by a

332
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:20,309
toenail butt-naked from a Portuguese

333
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:22,619
hot-air balloon or Olivia your set of

334
00:44:20,309 --> 00:44:23,239
priorities tends to change a bit I guess

335
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:26,730
so

336
00:44:23,239 --> 00:44:28,609
nice view though huh no one complained

337
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:31,799
yeah do you mind

338
00:44:28,609 --> 00:44:32,809
go ahead I've got to take off for about

339
00:44:31,799 --> 00:44:35,579
an hour

340
00:44:32,809 --> 00:44:38,069

342
00:44:38,069 --> 00:44:43,559

347
00:44:59,370 --> 00:45:05,050
one of these places always have to be

348
00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:07,830
freezing then they give you these stupid

349
00:45:05,050 --> 00:45:17,680

353
00:45:22,270 --> 00:45:24,940
moment I thought you were trying to

354
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:30,370

389
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:51,480

00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:55,860
gather to satellite info and provide us

391
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:58,170
