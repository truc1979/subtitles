part for your CIA boy toy games I got a

380
00:43:50,369 --> 00:43:53,789
lot of work to do here that's why I'm

381
00:43:52,109 --> 00:43:55,019
here Martin thought that I can work the

382
00:43:53,789 --> 00:43:59,880
bugs out of your tracking device

383
00:43:55,019 --> 00:44:04,950
knock yourself out ah what seems to be

384
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:09,059
the trouble it's not working I got that

385
00:44:04,950 --> 00:44:10,529
much did you drop it or well yeah from

386
00:44:09,059 --> 00:44:13,680
about 50 feet up in the air

387
00:44:10,529 --> 00:44:16,170
that sounds pretty reckless even from

388
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:18,239
you well when you're hanging by a

389
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:20,309

hot-air balloon or Olivia your set of

391
00:44:20,309 --> 00:44:23,239
priorities tends to change a bit I guess

469
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:55,860
gather to satellite info and provide us

470
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:58,170

480
00:53:28,019 --> 00:53:34,680
just probably suspected as soon as dr.

481
00:53:31,630 --> 00:53:38,009
