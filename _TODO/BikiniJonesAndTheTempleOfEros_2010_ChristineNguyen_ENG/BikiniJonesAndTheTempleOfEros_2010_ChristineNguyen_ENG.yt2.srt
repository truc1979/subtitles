55
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:47,360
arrows - right from under their noses

56
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:49,490

gorilla is absolutely having a cow over

59
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:57,140
this and while she might we have to

60
00:10:55,670 --> 00:11:00,380
ensure that this never falls into her

61
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:02,210
hands again don't forget our deal I keep

62
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:04,700
the idol for my research and when I'm

63
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:06,590
done you CIA boys can have it for your

64
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:08,510
little collection I wish you'd

65
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:10,070
reconsider our agreement dr. Jones we

66
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:12,770
can't afford to have that floating

67
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:15,310
around out there somewhere it won't be

68
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:20,060
floating anywhere it will be with me

69
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:22,520
I'll take good care of it you realize

70
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:25,250
that on that Idol somewhere is the

71
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:27,920
location of the temple of arrows exactly

72
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:31,610
and whoever finds the temple finds a

73
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:35,000
tiara of Aisha exactly and whoever has

74
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:39,410
the tiara of Aisha shall be the ruler of

75
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,190
the Empire of moronica can you believe

76
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:42,440
Avilla

77
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:44,720
Cruella with all her millions still

78
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:47,050
wants to be ruler of the Empire that's

79
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,700
not gonna happen we're counting on you

80
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:51,590
listen Martin I'll give you this trinket

81
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:54,020

00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:54,680
temple that's all I'm interested in and

83
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:58,940

I want that Idol it's mine by right of

90
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:29,610
my ancestry perhaps but I thought you

were from Hoboken hoebuck well my

92
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:36,059
grandpa did settle there but my real

93
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:39,800
destiny is the Empire of moronica yes of

94
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:42,389
course this is all very unfortunate I

95
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:45,660
entrusted my spies to bring me my idol

96
00:12:42,389 --> 00:12:47,939
we had it but it slipped away and I

97
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:50,670
wanted back how can we help you achieve

98
00:12:47,939 --> 00:12:52,829
your goals mistress I must have that

99
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:55,619
idol it alone has the location of the

100
00:12:52,829 --> 00:12:59,040
temple of uros with it I can acquire the

101
00:12:55,619 --> 00:13:01,709
tiara of Aisha and rule all of Morocco

102
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:04,110
and then you will be the supreme Empress

103
00:13:01,709 --> 00:13:07,170
of moronica suits me well don't you

104
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:09,689

archeologist has it in her possession

109
00:13:17,629 --> 00:13:22,799

110
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:25,970
rally our spies in America and bring me

111
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:46,809

00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:32,740
power of a highly poisonous and very

pissed-off snake sounds like you've been

158
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:37,600
through a lot and I've got the bruises

159
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:40,480

160
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:44,560
dangerous life like you do needs to

161
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:46,620

00:26:41,459 --> 00:26:47,899
that Idol you could be a very rich woman

193
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:49,950
what's money to me you could have power

194
00:26:47,899 --> 00:26:51,839
lots of power

195
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:54,529
I'm already telling the CIA where to

196
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:57,149
stick it how much more power do I need

197
00:26:54,529 --> 00:27:00,509

this strange guy in my house and he was

218
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:13,710
stealing the idol yes yes I had the

219
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:15,300
upper hand and then he told me that he

220
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:18,810
Villa Cruella went to be Empress of

221
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:22,650
moronica she comes from a long line of

222
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:24,900
morons from Hoboken so I'm told yeah

223
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:27,390
that's what I thought too but the bottom

224
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:30,120
line is whoever finds a tear of Aisha

225
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:30,600
can crown themselves Empress it's a slam

226
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:35,760

00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:18,690
you well when you're hanging by a

321
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:20,310

air balloon or Olivia your set of

323
00:44:20,310 --> 00:44:25,470
