77
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:47,360
arrows - right from under their noses

78
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:49,490

gorilla is absolutely having a cow over

81
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:57,140
this and while she might we have to

82
00:10:55,670 --> 00:11:00,380
ensure that this never falls into her

83
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:02,210
hands again don't forget our deal I keep

84
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:04,700
the idol for my research and when I'm

85
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:06,590
done you CIA boys can have it for your

86
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:08,510
little collection I wish you'd

87
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:10,070
reconsider our agreement dr. Jones we

88
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:12,770
can't afford to have that floating

89
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:15,310
around out there somewhere it won't be

90
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:20,060
floating anywhere it will be with me

91
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:22,520
I'll take good care of it you realize

92
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:25,250
that on that Idol somewhere is the

93
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:27,920
location of the temple of arrows exactly

94
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:31,610
and whoever finds the temple finds a

95
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:35,000
tiara of Aisha exactly and whoever has

96
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:39,410
the tiara of Aisha shall be the ruler of

97
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,190
the Empire of moronica can you believe

105
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:58,940

destiny is the Empire of moronica yes of

117
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:42,389

118
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:45,660
entrusted my spies to bring me my idol

119
00:12:42,389 --> 00:12:47,939

idol it alone has the location of the

123
00:12:52,829 --> 00:12:59,040
temple of uros with it I can acquire the

124
00:12:55,619 --> 00:13:01,709
tiara of Aisha and rule all of Morocco

125
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:04,110

stealing the idol yes yes I had the

261
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:15,300
upper hand and then he told me that he

262
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:18,810
Villa Cruella went to be Empress of

263
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:22,650

00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:24,900
morons from Hoboken so I'm told yeah
