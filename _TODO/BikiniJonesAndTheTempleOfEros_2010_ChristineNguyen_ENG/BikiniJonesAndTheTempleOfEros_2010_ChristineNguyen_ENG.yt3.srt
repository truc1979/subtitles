00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,940
I stole the sacred Idol of arrows -

55
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:47,340
right from under their noses

56
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:49,440

Agrella

59
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:56,010
is absolutely having a cow over this and

60
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:57,690
while she might we have to ensure that

61
00:10:56,010 --> 00:11:00,780
this never falls into our hands again

62
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:03,300
don't forget our deal I keep the idol

63
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:04,950
for my research and when I'm done you

64
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:07,350
CIA boys can have it for your little

65
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:09,240
collection I wish you'd reconsider our

66
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:10,620
agreement dr. Jones we can't afford to

67
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,830
have that floating around out there

68
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:16,830
somewhere it won't be floating anywhere

69
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:21,180
it will be with me I'll take good care

70
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:23,580
of it you realize that on that Idol

71
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:26,820
somewhere is the location of the temple

72
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:30,570
of eros exactly and whoever finds the

73
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:34,350
temple finds a tiara of Aisha exactly

74
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:37,790
and whoever has the tiara of Aisha shall

75
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:40,260
be the ruler of the Empire of moronica

76
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:42,450
can you believe a villa

77
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:44,730
Krewella with all her millions still

78
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:47,060
wants to be ruler of the Empire that's

79
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:49,680
not gonna happen we're counting on you

80
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:51,660
listen Martin I'll give you this trinket

81
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,060
as soon as I decipher the map to the

82
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:58,530
temple that's all I'm interested in and

83
00:11:54,060 --> 00:12:01,290

84
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:04,200

00:42:52,309 --> 00:42:59,569
tracking device in the base of the idol

301
00:42:55,059 --> 00:43:01,369

302
00:42:59,569 --> 00:43:03,980

that's why I'm here

316
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:55,980
Lauren thought that I can work the bugs

317
00:43:53,940 --> 00:44:00,030
out of your tracking device knock

318
00:43:55,980 --> 00:44:05,160
yourself out ah what seems to be the

319
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:09,300
trouble it's not working I got that much

320
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:10,230
did you drop it or well yeah from about

321
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:13,650
50 feet up in the air

322
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:16,170
that sounds pretty reckless even from

323
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:18,240
you well when you're hanging by a

324
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:20,310
toenail butt-naked from a Portuguese

325
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:22,620
hot-air balloon or Olivia your set of

326
00:44:20,310 --> 00:44:23,240
priorities tends to change a bit I guess

327
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:26,730
so

328
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:28,610
nice view though huh no one complained

329
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:31,710
yeah do you mind

330
00:44:28,610 --> 00:44:32,810
go ahead I've got to take off for about

331
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:35,550
an hour

332
00:44:32,810 --> 00:44:36,270

334
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:41,850
Marvin sent me up with a certain dr.

335
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:43,560

336
00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:45,150

00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:05,340
these places always have to be freezing

340
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:14,370
then they give you these stupid gowns

341
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:16,700
with your butt hanging out honestly so

342
00:45:14,370 --> 00:45:19,290

344
00:45:19,290 --> 00:45:23,220

345
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:24,590

346
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:31,770

can you locate the idol not clear yet

390
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:31,640

391
00:53:28,029 --> 00:53:34,690
just what we suspected as soon as dr.

392
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:42,049
Jones returns I'll be on my way

393
00:53:34,690 --> 00:53:48,559
