89
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:57,690
while she might we have to ensure that

90
00:10:56,010 --> 00:11:00,780
this never falls into our hands again

91
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:03,300
don't forget our deal I keep the idol

92
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:04,950
for my research and when I'm done you

93
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:07,350
CIA boys can have it for your little

94
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:09,240
collection I wish you'd reconsider our

95
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:10,620
agreement dr. Jones we can't afford to

96
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,830
have that floating around out there

97
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:16,830
somewhere it won't be floating anywhere

98
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:21,180
it will be with me I'll take good care

99
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:23,580
of it you realize that on that Idol

100
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:26,820
somewhere is the location of the temple

101
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:30,570
of eros exactly and whoever finds the

102
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:34,350
temple finds a tiara of Aisha exactly

103
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:37,790
and whoever has the tiara of Aisha shall

104
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:40,260
be the ruler of the Empire of moronica

105
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:42,450

106
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:44,730
Krewella with all her millions still

00:42:52,309 --> 00:42:59,569
tracking device in the base of the idol

383
00:42:55,059 --> 00:43:01,369

384
00:42:59,569 --> 00:43:03,980
tracking device is on the blank and I

385
00:43:01,369 --> 00:43:04,369

389
00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:20,750

390
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:26,180

398
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:55,980
Lauren thought that I can work the bugs

399
00:43:53,940 --> 00:44:00,030
out of your tracking device knock

400
00:43:55,980 --> 00:44:05,160
yourself out ah what seems to be the

401
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:09,300
trouble it's not working I got that much

402
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:10,230
did you drop it or well yeah from about

403
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:13,650
50 feet up in the air

404
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:16,170
that sounds pretty reckless even from

405
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:18,240
you well when you're hanging by a

406
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:20,310
toenail butt-naked from a Portuguese

407
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:22,620
hot-air balloon or Olivia your set of

408
00:44:20,310 --> 00:44:23,240
priorities tends to change a bit I guess

409
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:26,730
so

410
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:28,610

411
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:31,710
