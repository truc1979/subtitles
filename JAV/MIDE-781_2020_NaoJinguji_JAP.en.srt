1
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:35,620
I'm new to Tokyo

2
00:00:35,645 --> 00:00:38,865
After all, it might have been nice to meet you

3
00:00:38,946 --> 00:00:42,196
It will be okay ~ I'm not a kid

4
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,813
I'm worried even if I say that

5
00:00:44,838 --> 00:00:46,618
Miho Don't worry too much ...

6
00:00:46,743 --> 00:00:48,384
-I think I'm here.
-Come, come.

7
00:00:49,342 --> 00:00:50,881
Let's go ~

8
00:00:55,325 --> 00:00:57,249
-Come out ~!
- sister!!

9
00:00:57,274 --> 00:00:59,001
I waited!

10
00:00:59,381 --> 00:01:00,896
Thanks

11
00:01:01,157 --> 00:01:04,528
I was worried ~ I can find it right here

12
00:01:04,553 --> 00:01:06,071
Nice to meet you

13
00:01:06,623 --> 00:01:10,138
It's been a long time, I'll be starting today

14
00:01:10,286 --> 00:01:13,124
What are you doing so hard ~

15
00:01:13,149 --> 00:01:14,803
I put the room away.

16
00:01:14,828 --> 00:01:16,032
Thank you

17
00:01:16,057 --> 00:01:18,071
You don't have to say that, come in

18
00:01:18,096 --> 00:01:19,602
Take off your shoes here

19
00:01:23,006 --> 00:01:24,568
This way, this way

20
00:01:26,771 --> 00:01:28,086
Isn't that cool?

21
00:01:28,111 --> 00:01:29,594
- Yeah···
- right?

22
00:01:33,652 --> 00:01:34,859
This way

23
00:01:35,071 --> 00:01:36,805
Don't refrain

24
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,586
I mean ~
Are you nervous?

25
00:01:40,164 --> 00:01:41,796
Why don't you put your luggage down

26
00:01:41,821 --> 00:01:43,399
Yes, give me

27
00:01:44,946 --> 00:01:46,727
Put this down

28
00:01:54,618 --> 00:01:56,446
What is it, why?

29
00:01:56,688 --> 00:01:59,227
-It's a gift.
- Really? Thanks

30
00:01:59,532 --> 00:02:00,868
What is this

31
00:02:02,485 --> 00:02:05,954
This is a shop castella near my house, right?

32
00:02:05,979 --> 00:02:07,681
-Did you live on the way?
- Huh!

33
00:02:07,706 --> 00:02:10,430
Wow this is really good ~

34
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:11,993
I want to eat

35
00:02:12,018 --> 00:02:13,211
That's fortunate

36
00:02:13,751 --> 00:02:15,085
Cut or cut?

37
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:16,149
Yes

38
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:17,587
I want to eat quickly

39
00:02:17,612 --> 00:02:20,461
Yeah, you forgot to eat because you were worried

40
00:02:21,104 --> 00:02:22,899
Sit down, sit down

41
00:02:23,329 --> 00:02:26,110
I'm glad ~ I'm getting out of the car

42
00:02:26,135 --> 00:02:27,383
Thank you

43
00:02:28,126 --> 00:02:29,586
Can I help you?

44
00:02:29,611 --> 00:02:30,922
OK

45
00:02:30,947 --> 00:02:32,477
- Really?
-Sit down

46
00:02:38,243 --> 00:02:39,602
Delicious ~

47
00:02:41,634 --> 00:02:43,777
How did you get to Tokyo?

48
00:02:44,673 --> 00:02:46,414
I'm on the tram.

49
00:02:46,571 --> 00:02:48,539
It took a long time

50
00:02:48,564 --> 00:02:50,633
Why aren't you flying?

51
00:02:50,835 --> 00:02:55,860
The atmosphere of the city
I wanted to feel it

52
00:02:57,023 --> 00:02:58,774
So you're late?

53
00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:00,862
I sold a little glance

54
00:03:01,267 --> 00:03:05,918
I was really worried
Do you know how many hours you waited?

55
00:03:06,065 --> 00:03:08,593
Miho continued to worry

56
00:03:09,852 --> 00:03:11,402
You're right, though

57
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:13,391
I'm glad

58
00:03:15,981 --> 00:03:18,867
I arrived at my parents well
Wouldn't it be nice to contact you?

59
00:03:21,312 --> 00:03:22,524
Are you okay?

60
00:03:22,549 --> 00:03:24,330
I'll do it

61
00:03:24,355 --> 00:03:27,625
I'll listen to you again
Don't you want to hear nagging?

62
00:03:27,877 --> 00:03:29,143
like that

63
00:03:31,073 --> 00:03:32,484
It's a big deal

64
00:03:35,672 --> 00:03:37,461
Why are you confused?

65
00:03:38,423 --> 00:03:40,117
What are you confused with?

66
00:03:40,422 --> 00:03:43,422
When will you get a job?

67
00:03:44,805 --> 00:03:46,383
I'm sorry

68
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:49,176
You don't have to rush

69
00:03:49,201 --> 00:03:50,508
Any problems?

70
00:03:51,245 --> 00:03:54,004
I think it's my home
You can stay comfortable

71
00:03:54,029 --> 00:03:55,793
I'm really going to lose weight

72
00:03:56,181 --> 00:03:59,914
If you find a real room, you will go out right away.

73
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:01,665
-Thank you so far.
-No, it's okay.

74
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,430
I don't need to hurry

75
00:04:03,455 --> 00:04:05,446
If you hurry and find a place to live

76
00:04:05,827 --> 00:04:07,126
fairly···

77
00:04:07,171 --> 00:04:08,753
I will regret it

78
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,207
Because it's a woman

79
00:04:12,529 --> 00:04:14,582
It might be dangerous.

80
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:19,296
If you live on the first floor, strange people may get twisted

81
00:04:19,321 --> 00:04:20,749
Yes, underwear thief.

82
00:04:20,774 --> 00:04:25,196
Second floor or third floor?
I need to find it carefully

83
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:28,063
Until then, you can stay here ...

84
00:04:28,088 --> 00:04:29,244
I'm sorry

85
00:04:30,425 --> 00:04:32,148
Where is work ...

86
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,840
Oh yeah

87
00:04:34,009 --> 00:04:35,954
First of all, it is the most urgent

88
00:04:36,435 --> 00:04:39,327
You can take it slowly, step by step.

89
00:04:41,742 --> 00:04:43,645
I think it's your home

90
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:45,293
I'm really sorry

91
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:47,020
Don't do that ~

92
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:50,047
What does Nao-chan want to do?

93
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:55,074
Actually, I wanted to be a cartoonist.

94
00:04:55,535 --> 00:04:56,645
That···

95
00:04:56,948 --> 00:04:58,296
Now is

96
00:04:58,321 --> 00:05:00,426
I'm looking for something normal.

97
00:05:00,497 --> 00:05:01,653
like that

98
00:05:02,137 --> 00:05:03,424
It's a big deal

99
00:05:03,449 --> 00:05:05,771
-Still, really good
- like that

100
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,430
Do you often draw now?

101
00:05:10,455 --> 00:05:11,461
Huh···

102
00:05:12,311 --> 00:05:13,701
I knew it

103
00:05:13,898 --> 00:05:15,500
Did you bring it?

104
00:05:15,806 --> 00:05:18,613
-Show me later
-I miss you too

105
00:05:19,282 --> 00:05:20,649
Not really

106
00:05:22,562 --> 00:05:24,393
Let me guide you through my house

107
00:05:24,418 --> 00:05:25,420
Huh!

108
00:05:25,524 --> 00:05:28,194
First, here is the bathroom

109
00:05:28,219 --> 00:05:29,296
- bathroom
- okay

110
00:05:29,321 --> 00:05:30,810
Bathroom and sink

111
00:05:32,226 --> 00:05:33,392
wide

112
00:05:35,722 --> 00:05:39,689
When I get that bath.
The lever is a little bad

113
00:05:40,463 --> 00:05:43,546
It's better to turn it on than take it off

114
00:05:44,686 --> 00:05:47,016
Then you can avoid the cold

115
00:05:47,058 --> 00:05:48,299
Ok

116
00:05:51,697 --> 00:05:55,259
Right here ...

117
00:05:57,101 --> 00:05:59,150
-It's a bathroom.
-Hwajingsil?

118
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:02,573
This is my sister ...

119
00:06:02,601 --> 00:06:04,249
You're using washlet
* Japanese Bidet

120
00:06:05,696 --> 00:06:06,714
okay

121
00:06:06,739 --> 00:06:08,745
That's awesome, I write it once

122
00:06:08,892 --> 00:06:13,280
I don't know well, I just use what was installed

123
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,613
This ...

124
00:06:18,089 --> 00:06:20,566
-Can you wipe your ass?
-Yes

125
00:06:20,591 --> 00:06:23,105
You can use it, but be careful when you use it

126
00:06:23,722 --> 00:06:27,175
In the first too strong century
You may not be able to adapt

127
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,540
Yes, I might be surprised
In the beginning, it would be better to use a weak setting.

128
00:06:30,572 --> 00:06:33,195
- weak?
-Yes, with weak strength

129
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:36,628
If you don't press the stop button
Be careful because it may turn into the water of the bathroom

130
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,721
like that

131
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,581
I have never used it

132
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,027
Ok

133
00:06:43,052 --> 00:06:44,261
Write carefully

134
00:06:44,854 --> 00:06:46,104
restroom

135
00:06:46,353 --> 00:06:49,605
Next is Nao's room.

136
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,378
Here is the room

137
00:06:59,057 --> 00:07:03,662
This is the original guest room.
There will be no inconvenience in writing

138
00:07:03,687 --> 00:07:05,277
Yes, thank you

139
00:07:05,302 --> 00:07:06,612
Wide ~

140
00:07:06,637 --> 00:07:07,878
so?

141
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:09,505
Is the room good?

142
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,648
Wow, you have a bed.

143
00:07:17,197 --> 00:07:20,188
If you have any difficulties
Should I talk properly?

144
00:07:20,213 --> 00:07:21,299
Huh

145
00:07:22,033 --> 00:07:24,199
Then this is a spare key ~

146
00:07:24,224 --> 00:07:25,480
Thanks

147
00:07:25,513 --> 00:07:27,151
Can't we lose it?

148
00:07:27,176 --> 00:07:28,533
Ok

149
00:07:28,682 --> 00:07:31,668
Then I'm going to go cook
I'll call you when it's done

150
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:34,175
-I've been resting until now.
- Huh!

151
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,460
No way ...

152
00:08:51,725 --> 00:08:53,187
Is it a lie?

153
00:08:54,687 --> 00:08:55,835
Sister ...?

154
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,336
out? I'm not going to eat?

155
00:09:07,765 --> 00:09:09,671
Yes, I'll eat well

156
00:09:14,252 --> 00:09:17,272
Nao, your face looks bad.
Where is it not good?

157
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:18,849
no

158
00:09:18,963 --> 00:09:21,245
I'm just trying to sleep

159
00:09:25,222 --> 00:09:27,429
Sorry, were you noisy?

160
00:09:28,007 --> 00:09:29,635
Huh? what?

161
00:09:31,078 --> 00:09:33,069
Maybe you heard something strange?

162
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:34,760
There is no sound

163
00:09:47,412 --> 00:09:49,351
Gee, it's time to go

164
00:09:50,648 --> 00:09:51,741
thank you

165
00:09:52,187 --> 00:09:53,929
What time are you coming today?

166
00:09:53,954 --> 00:09:56,364
I'm going to be a little late because I have an accounting today.

167
00:09:56,389 --> 00:09:57,905
Don't take my share

168
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,241
Okay, then I'll eat out with Nao.

169
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,530
Nao, are you okay?

170
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,007
Huh··

171
00:10:03,124 --> 00:10:04,646
Then I will go.

172
00:10:07,077 --> 00:10:08,437
Bye

173
00:10:08,585 --> 00:10:09,913
Bye···

174
00:10:35,523 --> 00:10:38,288
You can go crazy, so give me more

175
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:21,507
No, go away!

176
00:11:23,335 --> 00:11:25,390
It's gone ...! Wait

177
00:12:21,895 --> 00:12:23,043
More ...!

178
00:12:40,137 --> 00:12:41,981
Oh no!

179
00:13:12,506 --> 00:13:13,623
Wait a minute

180
00:13:13,858 --> 00:13:15,967
Go away again!

181
00:15:36,139 --> 00:15:37,850
I can't ...

182
00:15:38,514 --> 00:15:40,052
I'm gone

183
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:42,630
No, no more ...

184
00:18:55,436 --> 00:18:56,717
No way ...

185
00:18:58,272 --> 00:19:00,585
I'm really like a pervert ...

186
00:19:07,872 --> 00:19:09,279
No, I can't ...

187
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,873
I'm going to lose this ...

188
00:22:26,916 --> 00:22:35,932
The fierce sex life of a married sister
The sister-in-law I witnessed had lust ...

189
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:43,076
Sunday 11:00 AM

190
00:22:43,109 --> 00:22:44,178
Honey?

191
00:22:44,616 --> 00:22:47,388
I had yakisoba for lunch, okay?

192
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:48,952
Uh, good

193
00:22:49,239 --> 00:22:50,748
Then I will go.

194
00:22:50,913 --> 00:22:52,179
Go ~

195
00:24:19,478 --> 00:24:22,392
What's the stock again?

196
00:24:38,015 --> 00:24:39,546
What are you waiting for ?!

197
00:24:40,665 --> 00:24:43,088
Nao, what is Nao-chan doing?

198
00:24:43,463 --> 00:24:44,658
Stop, stop

199
00:24:45,633 --> 00:24:47,196
What are you doing?

200
00:24:51,563 --> 00:24:53,244
What's going on ...

201
00:24:57,642 --> 00:24:58,869
Wait a minute

202
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,541
Why do you do that, calm down ...

203
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:21,642
What's what what's doing, stop stop stop

204
00:25:25,908 --> 00:25:27,260
Such a place ...

205
00:25:43,307 --> 00:25:45,533
No ... Nao-chan doesn't work.

206
00:25:50,157 --> 00:25:51,611
What is this?

207
00:26:06,252 --> 00:26:08,744
Gee, calm, calm down

208
00:26:26,315 --> 00:26:28,275
What, what

209
00:26:30,369 --> 00:26:31,892
Stop, stop

210
00:26:32,994 --> 00:26:34,104
awhile

211
00:26:34,245 --> 00:26:36,166
When I come back, what do I do when I come back

212
00:26:36,191 --> 00:26:37,431
No

213
00:27:29,197 --> 00:27:30,635
It's not there

214
00:28:19,376 --> 00:28:20,618
Nao-chan?

215
00:28:20,854 --> 00:28:22,470
Why is it ...

216
00:29:20,472 --> 00:29:21,723
No

217
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:30,339
No, no, no

218
00:30:31,672 --> 00:30:33,289
No no ...

219
00:30:34,118 --> 00:30:35,469
I'll put it

220
00:30:37,868 --> 00:30:40,172
Gee, calm, calm down

221
00:30:40,197 --> 00:30:41,485
Calm down

222
00:30:49,946 --> 00:30:52,227
What x5

223
00:30:53,743 --> 00:30:55,375
No, no

224
00:30:55,423 --> 00:30:57,515
Difficult to find ...

225
00:30:57,774 --> 00:30:59,782
No wait

226
00:31:22,508 --> 00:31:24,195
No no no

227
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:27,508
It's awesome ... It feels so good.

228
00:31:31,876 --> 00:31:33,305
I can't ...

229
00:31:52,899 --> 00:31:55,024
No, I feel good ...

230
00:32:13,235 --> 00:32:14,391
I feel good

231
00:32:24,938 --> 00:32:26,383
I like it so much ...

232
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,594
No

233
00:32:57,672 --> 00:32:58,813
Good mood

234
00:33:10,939 --> 00:33:12,892
You can't move like that ...

235
00:33:20,643 --> 00:33:21,830
Ok

236
00:33:22,095 --> 00:33:23,666
I love it here ...!

237
00:33:24,088 --> 00:33:25,104
What are you doing?

238
00:33:29,166 --> 00:33:30,767
This is a little dangerous

239
00:33:42,018 --> 00:33:43,252
Gandaad ...

240
00:33:44,791 --> 00:33:45,893
Gandat ...

241
00:33:52,549 --> 00:33:54,213
Insertion saying no ...

242
00:34:08,803 --> 00:34:10,813
I fell in love with this

243
00:34:37,523 --> 00:34:39,960
What's really real?

244
00:34:59,565 --> 00:35:00,722
I feel good ...

245
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:11,379
No···

246
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:15,512
It's intense ... it's intense!

247
00:35:19,598 --> 00:35:21,926
No ... it's too intense

248
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:26,295
Good mood··

249
00:35:30,312 --> 00:35:31,530
No

250
00:35:42,962 --> 00:35:44,624
That's not possible ...!

251
00:35:44,649 --> 00:35:45,920
It's too bad!

252
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:22,779
I feel good

253
00:36:29,327 --> 00:36:31,186
Go away ... Ganda ...

254
00:36:31,265 --> 00:36:32,459
I'm gone again ...

255
00:36:53,397 --> 00:36:54,554
No

256
00:36:57,218 --> 00:36:58,811
No, that's ...

257
00:37:24,261 --> 00:37:25,730
I feel good

258
00:37:40,795 --> 00:37:42,678
More ... more

259
00:38:04,325 --> 00:38:05,795
Put it in ...

260
00:38:06,905 --> 00:38:08,277
Put it in ...?

261
00:38:11,104 --> 00:38:12,558
I can't

262
00:38:13,027 --> 00:38:14,785
I'll be back soon ...

263
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:21,277
Touch your butt

264
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:51,238
Go away ... Ganda ... Gandaat ...

265
00:39:06,402 --> 00:39:09,050
Really come out ...!

266
00:39:14,011 --> 00:39:15,597
Stop now, let's stop?

267
00:39:15,622 --> 00:39:18,175
Miho will be back, so come back ...

268
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,793
Wait, I'm really coming back

269
00:39:40,238 --> 00:39:41,527
Touch me ...

270
00:39:50,862 --> 00:39:52,284
Do you feel good?

271
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:55,910
It feels good, but it really doesn't work.

272
00:39:56,668 --> 00:39:58,449
-I'm coming back.
- It's okay

273
00:40:00,402 --> 00:40:02,769
I'll be back, I'll be back ...

274
00:40:03,784 --> 00:40:05,597
It's okay, so be quiet

275
00:40:21,503 --> 00:40:24,175
Now, you can see it well ...?

276
00:40:28,238 --> 00:40:29,910
Good mood···

277
00:40:42,378 --> 00:40:43,550
So good

278
00:40:47,222 --> 00:40:48,918
I feel good here

279
00:40:54,823 --> 00:40:56,285
It feels good ...?

280
00:40:56,949 --> 00:40:59,371
Good but not good

281
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:15,449
It's still erection.

282
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,082
No ...

283
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:36,675
Then it will be cheap

284
00:41:36,708 --> 00:41:37,892
What ~?

285
00:41:39,168 --> 00:41:40,839
Yes ~? I can't hear you ~?

286
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:42,177
I really can't ...

287
00:41:42,202 --> 00:41:43,722
Would you like to put it in?

288
00:41:55,035 --> 00:41:56,199
Good··

289
00:41:56,410 --> 00:41:57,692
I love it!

290
00:42:31,331 --> 00:42:32,941
No ... Stop it

291
00:42:32,974 --> 00:42:34,433
Move it ...

292
00:42:50,676 --> 00:42:52,519
Kanda ... Kanda ...

293
00:43:08,231 --> 00:43:09,551
I feel good ...

294
00:43:12,487 --> 00:43:15,183
I feel good ... I'll be cheap again

295
00:43:23,371 --> 00:43:24,910
I feel good

296
00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:28,629
Feel better ...

297
00:43:30,808 --> 00:43:33,027
No, it'll be really cheap

298
00:43:52,488 --> 00:43:53,723
Good mood··

299
00:44:04,402 --> 00:44:05,675
I feel good ...

300
00:44:12,504 --> 00:44:13,902
More ... more!

301
00:44:13,927 --> 00:44:15,644
I really can't because it's cheap

302
00:44:15,994 --> 00:44:18,695
More ... more ... more!

303
00:44:20,665 --> 00:44:22,376
I feel good

304
00:44:24,539 --> 00:44:27,117
You can't really touch the nipples there ...

305
00:44:27,142 --> 00:44:28,351
Good

306
00:44:28,726 --> 00:44:30,133
You like this

307
00:44:52,407 --> 00:44:54,040
Go ... go again

308
00:44:54,313 --> 00:44:55,391
go away··

309
00:45:01,742 --> 00:45:03,617
Kanda ... Kandaat ...

310
00:45:23,133 --> 00:45:24,524
I can't do that

311
00:45:32,128 --> 00:45:33,433
I feel good ...

312
00:45:34,136 --> 00:45:35,433
Do you feel good?

313
00:45:54,769 --> 00:45:55,979
Go again

314
00:45:56,004 --> 00:45:57,371
Go away ...!

315
00:46:03,699 --> 00:46:06,300
No more ... No more!

316
00:46:06,996 --> 00:46:08,277
It's okay ...

317
00:46:09,245 --> 00:46:10,949
Good ... so good

318
00:46:11,410 --> 00:46:12,456
more··

319
00:46:51,339 --> 00:46:52,550
It's the limit ...!

320
00:46:56,691 --> 00:46:58,058
Cheap ··!

321
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:09,980
No no

322
00:47:11,277 --> 00:47:12,761
I really can't

323
00:47:39,644 --> 00:47:42,653
Hide it from your sister and enjoy it with me ♥

324
00:47:44,871 --> 00:47:46,331
Stop stop

325
00:47:49,550 --> 00:47:50,761
I'm here ~

326
00:47:51,105 --> 00:47:52,543
This is dangerous ...

327
00:47:58,785 --> 00:48:01,284
It's really difficult, difficult!

328
00:48:01,363 --> 00:48:02,996
This way

329
00:48:06,339 --> 00:48:07,941
Here it comes

330
00:48:08,472 --> 00:48:09,902
I can't

331
00:48:11,449 --> 00:48:12,668
I'm here ~

332
00:48:14,707 --> 00:48:16,058
What are you doing?

333
00:48:17,121 --> 00:48:18,543
No, just···

334
00:48:19,293 --> 00:48:21,378
What did you do in that way?

335
00:48:21,527 --> 00:48:23,761
That's a little exercise ...

336
00:48:23,786 --> 00:48:24,933
Exercise?

337
00:48:25,425 --> 00:48:28,003
Don't wear panties

338
00:48:58,714 --> 00:49:00,783
You can eat first

339
00:49:00,808 --> 00:49:01,823
Huh

340
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:05,658
Monday 8:00 AM
Honey? In the next 10 minutes
Lunch box is ready, can you wait a minute?

341
00:49:05,683 --> 00:49:07,300
Monday 8:00 AM
yea, I got it

342
00:49:47,161 --> 00:49:48,419
Oh, thanks

343
00:49:56,302 --> 00:49:58,888
Honey, is it too late today?

344
00:49:59,943 --> 00:50:01,857
Uh yeah maybe

345
00:50:02,037 --> 00:50:03,677
I think it will be late

346
00:50:03,702 --> 00:50:05,669
What about Bob?

347
00:50:05,967 --> 00:50:07,974
I'll be rough

348
00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:09,506
Ok

349
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:19,216
Today's packed lunch

350
00:51:19,241 --> 00:51:20,740
Ah, thank you

351
00:51:20,765 --> 00:51:24,039
Three people on the next holiday
Where will you go?

352
00:51:24,817 --> 00:51:27,133
Is there somewhere you want to go?

353
00:51:28,286 --> 00:51:29,583
Where should I be ...

354
00:51:30,372 --> 00:51:32,731
Do you think it's a zoo or something?

355
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:34,419
Zoo?

356
00:51:34,638 --> 00:51:37,591
Yeah, it's been a while since

357
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:49,442
- what?
- Yes?

358
00:51:49,467 --> 00:51:50,755
Coming out?

359
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:54,466
Come out, come out, maybe toilet

360
00:51:54,491 --> 00:51:55,966
Oh, the bathroom

361
00:52:34,581 --> 00:52:35,698
Ah!

362
00:52:35,838 --> 00:52:38,666
Today's egg roll is a little bit fresh but is it okay?

363
00:52:38,707 --> 00:52:39,995
Yes

364
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:41,268
OK

365
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:45,667
Must I eat everything?

366
00:52:45,893 --> 00:52:47,292
Yes

367
00:54:21,181 --> 00:54:23,759
Packed lunch

368
00:54:27,772 --> 00:54:29,548
-Did you wait ~?
- thank you

369
00:54:29,573 --> 00:54:31,436
Oh, I'll be late

370
00:54:31,891 --> 00:54:34,069
-Let's go.
-Ok

371
00:54:34,272 --> 00:54:35,842
what? out

372
00:54:36,741 --> 00:54:38,710
You got it in your mouth

373
00:54:41,367 --> 00:54:42,867
Lunch box

374
00:54:45,312 --> 00:54:46,601
Goodbye ~

375
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:48,921
Bye

376
00:55:09,234 --> 00:55:13,343
8:00 PM on the same day

377
00:55:19,155 --> 00:55:20,296
I'm here

378
00:55:24,819 --> 00:55:26,023
Miho?

379
00:55:30,124 --> 00:55:31,460
welcome

380
00:55:31,609 --> 00:55:32,780
What are you doing?

381
00:55:33,843 --> 00:55:35,203
What is that outfit

382
00:55:35,624 --> 00:55:37,023
What what what what

383
00:55:38,273 --> 00:55:40,663
My sister is eating with her friends

384
00:55:40,897 --> 00:55:42,366
No what is that

385
00:55:42,391 --> 00:55:43,767
It's Miho

386
00:55:43,792 --> 00:55:45,103
No

387
00:55:45,128 --> 00:55:46,515
I really can't

388
00:55:46,764 --> 00:55:48,233
Do you want to see more?

389
00:55:48,929 --> 00:55:51,796
No, you can see it all

390
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:53,700
Miho ~

391
00:55:56,210 --> 00:55:57,608
So there is no

392
00:55:57,633 --> 00:55:58,812
- Really?
- Huh!

393
00:55:59,117 --> 00:56:00,968
Good job

394
00:56:01,507 --> 00:56:03,944
Thank you

395
00:56:03,969 --> 00:56:05,444
Because it shouldn't be decorated

396
00:56:06,968 --> 00:56:08,874
No, it's okay.

397
00:56:11,382 --> 00:56:12,890
Why is that?

398
00:56:13,171 --> 00:56:14,476
Stop it

399
00:56:14,803 --> 00:56:15,874
I can see it all

400
00:56:15,907 --> 00:56:17,241
Put it in front of your hand

401
00:56:17,631 --> 00:56:18,897
What are you trying to do?

402
00:56:21,679 --> 00:56:22,874
awhile··?

403
00:56:27,085 --> 00:56:28,280
done!

404
00:56:28,867 --> 00:56:31,179
No no wait, what is what

405
00:56:31,204 --> 00:56:32,453
Live it

406
00:56:36,179 --> 00:56:38,569
Wait, Nao-chan

407
00:56:38,733 --> 00:56:40,085
Let's stop

408
00:56:40,315 --> 00:56:42,284
Miho, Miho will come back ...

409
00:56:43,456 --> 00:56:46,022
It's a big deal if it comes to Miho.

410
00:57:01,335 --> 00:57:03,796
If you do this at the front door because you can't wait for a while ...

411
00:57:03,821 --> 00:57:05,367
Keep quiet

412
00:57:07,022 --> 00:57:08,335
You're a little sweaty

413
00:57:15,545 --> 00:57:16,765
I can't

414
00:57:20,998 --> 00:57:22,209
Good···

415
00:57:28,999 --> 00:57:30,406
No

416
00:57:34,515 --> 00:57:35,804
No way

417
00:57:37,529 --> 00:57:39,584
I feel good

418
00:57:48,449 --> 00:57:50,160
I will continue

419
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:07,301
Oh wait

420
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:11,432
I'm gonna tell you I can't.

421
00:58:11,879 --> 00:58:13,293
I'm going to be caught

422
00:58:14,709 --> 00:58:16,121
It will smell

423
00:58:23,108 --> 00:58:24,746
The smell of sweat is mandibular ...

424
00:58:25,731 --> 00:58:27,012
where··

425
00:58:32,450 --> 00:58:34,019
No no no

426
00:58:34,044 --> 00:58:35,519
Why are you in an erection state?

427
00:58:51,871 --> 00:58:53,621
Nao-chan, isn't it dirty?

428
00:58:55,004 --> 00:58:56,480
Delicious ~?

429
00:59:02,129 --> 00:59:04,036
How many times did you go to the bathroom today?

430
00:59:04,566 --> 00:59:06,184
I don't know that

431
00:59:11,043 --> 00:59:12,777
I think it tastes like pee

432
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:47,770
I can't ...

433
01:00:00,778 --> 01:00:02,106
I feel good

434
01:00:04,104 --> 01:00:06,142
Will you free your hands?

435
01:00:07,886 --> 01:00:09,441
I want to move

436
01:00:16,363 --> 01:00:17,698
Let's stop now

437
01:00:18,765 --> 01:00:20,418
This kind of fire

438
01:00:20,443 --> 01:00:22,762
You're a good kid because you're caught by Miho?

439
01:00:23,846 --> 01:00:24,979
then

440
01:00:25,004 --> 01:00:27,199
I'll release it, so put it in

441
01:00:28,691 --> 01:00:29,925
No

442
01:00:29,950 --> 01:00:32,738
No, I'm going to be caught by Miho.

443
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:36,082
Let's talk, let's talk

444
01:00:36,107 --> 01:00:37,324
I hate it!

445
01:00:39,036 --> 01:00:40,245
Now, wait

446
01:00:40,270 --> 01:00:42,441
What are you doing ?!

447
01:00:42,871 --> 01:00:44,465
With this good thing ...

448
01:00:44,730 --> 01:00:47,793
I want to go like a sister too

449
01:00:48,817 --> 01:00:50,965
here? Come out

450
01:00:51,277 --> 01:00:53,152
I'm caught by Miho.

451
01:01:04,683 --> 01:01:05,965
I came in ...

452
01:01:06,512 --> 01:01:08,012
No no

453
01:01:08,981 --> 01:01:10,223
Nao-chan ...

454
01:01:17,277 --> 01:01:18,621
I feel good ...

455
01:01:20,504 --> 01:01:24,082
Do it violently like you did to your sister!

456
01:01:24,941 --> 01:01:26,160
stop···

457
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:28,996
Good···

458
01:01:40,340 --> 01:01:41,598
I feel good

459
01:01:43,176 --> 01:01:44,324
No··

460
01:01:49,504 --> 01:01:50,590
Good mood

461
01:01:54,418 --> 01:01:57,090
If you don't be quiet, you will hear it.

462
01:02:06,972 --> 01:02:08,207
So good

463
01:02:10,739 --> 01:02:12,004
No go away

464
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:13,433
Go away

465
01:02:19,856 --> 01:02:21,192
Gandaat

466
01:02:26,871 --> 01:02:28,121
No···

467
01:02:38,052 --> 01:02:40,090
No, no more

468
01:02:46,988 --> 01:02:48,043
more··!

469
01:02:48,832 --> 01:02:50,262
backwards···

470
01:02:54,660 --> 01:02:57,425
-Do it from behind
-Are you satisfied or not satisfied?

471
01:02:57,459 --> 01:02:58,544
awhile··!

472
01:03:00,075 --> 01:03:01,379
From behind ~!

473
01:03:04,238 --> 01:03:05,551
Quickly

474
01:03:11,370 --> 01:03:12,799
I can't do that

475
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:15,761
Really?

476
01:03:16,167 --> 01:03:17,401
I'm serious?

477
01:03:17,582 --> 01:03:19,254
Yes, fast.

478
01:03:28,340 --> 01:03:29,456
Hot

479
01:03:39,309 --> 01:03:41,691
Kiss me like you do to your sister

480
01:04:01,145 --> 01:04:02,395
I love it

481
01:04:13,441 --> 01:04:15,566
What, don't stop!

482
01:04:15,753 --> 01:04:16,948
What are you doing

483
01:04:17,949 --> 01:04:19,175
more··!

484
01:04:31,871 --> 01:04:33,441
I feel good ...

485
01:04:43,387 --> 01:04:45,997
Kanda ... go away again!

486
01:05:01,917 --> 01:05:04,214
Awesome, this is really ...

487
01:05:06,426 --> 01:05:08,176
What is it and why?

488
01:05:10,543 --> 01:05:12,066
In this place ...

489
01:05:13,285 --> 01:05:16,941
That's more intense with you.

490
01:05:39,402 --> 01:05:40,934
This is so good ··!

491
01:05:51,965 --> 01:05:53,098
Good mood···

492
01:05:56,792 --> 01:05:57,823
Let's stop

493
01:05:57,848 --> 01:05:59,346
why··? I do not like it!

494
01:05:59,934 --> 01:06:01,254
I can't

495
01:06:02,902 --> 01:06:04,168
Hate··!

496
01:06:04,223 --> 01:06:06,551
Calm down ... Calm down Nao-chan

497
01:06:06,863 --> 01:06:08,199
Knowing ...

498
01:06:11,278 --> 01:06:12,348
awhile···

499
01:06:33,457 --> 01:06:35,059
Hey, are you feeling good?

500
01:06:35,903 --> 01:06:37,387
It feels good ...

501
01:06:39,668 --> 01:06:41,098
So good

502
01:06:41,786 --> 01:06:42,816
here··!

503
01:06:48,152 --> 01:06:49,371
Good mood···

504
01:06:57,997 --> 01:06:59,004
more··

505
01:06:59,832 --> 01:07:01,215
More ... more!

506
01:07:01,512 --> 01:07:02,598
More!

507
01:07:24,847 --> 01:07:28,160
Kanda ... Kanda ... Kanda ...

508
01:07:35,246 --> 01:07:36,730
I can't ...

509
01:07:53,731 --> 01:07:56,387
Do you feel like turning around like this?

510
01:07:56,583 --> 01:07:57,848
Violent ...

511
01:08:12,199 --> 01:08:13,707
Please stab it more ...!

512
01:08:14,372 --> 01:08:15,426
More ...

513
01:08:17,676 --> 01:08:18,793
More ...

514
01:08:18,895 --> 01:08:20,059
Yes

515
01:08:23,019 --> 01:08:24,385
Stab me ...

516
01:08:24,816 --> 01:08:25,878
more··!!

517
01:09:03,074 --> 01:09:04,379
Let's stop

518
01:09:04,777 --> 01:09:07,012
It's time to come back.

519
01:09:07,037 --> 01:09:09,184
I'm not going to come back.

520
01:09:19,270 --> 01:09:20,582
It's lustful ...

521
01:09:27,762 --> 01:09:29,129
If you move like that ...!

522
01:09:32,582 --> 01:09:34,247
It feels good

523
01:09:34,434 --> 01:09:35,825
Rubbing like this ...

524
01:09:36,958 --> 01:09:38,410
Do you feel so good?

525
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:39,863
I feel so good

526
01:09:55,239 --> 01:09:56,746
More intense!

527
01:10:01,856 --> 01:10:03,645
I'm going to be cheap

528
01:10:08,473 --> 01:10:10,316
Then stab me more ♫

529
01:10:12,028 --> 01:10:13,692
I think it will be soon

530
01:10:23,770 --> 01:10:25,122
I'll be cheap

531
01:10:38,934 --> 01:10:40,668
Nao-chan, I can't.

532
01:10:41,262 --> 01:10:42,379
It's cheap ...

533
01:10:43,582 --> 01:10:45,223
Is this ...?

534
01:10:45,403 --> 01:10:47,590
No, it's really cheap

535
01:10:47,965 --> 01:10:49,294
Like this ~?

536
01:10:59,113 --> 01:11:00,136
Good mood···

537
01:11:00,379 --> 01:11:03,051
I love it so much ... more intensely!

538
01:11:04,980 --> 01:11:06,074
Like that ...

539
01:11:32,481 --> 01:11:33,832
It looks like rice ...

540
01:11:38,223 --> 01:11:39,870
It's really cheap

541
01:11:39,895 --> 01:11:40,996
good···

542
01:11:41,294 --> 01:11:43,223
It's cheap ...

543
01:11:47,668 --> 01:11:49,019
It's going to be rice

544
01:11:49,052 --> 01:11:50,426
Do you feel good?

545
01:11:51,044 --> 01:11:52,669
It's really good ...

546
01:12:03,309 --> 01:12:04,926
Really cheap ...!

547
01:12:05,473 --> 01:12:07,301
I like it ... I feel good ...

548
01:12:08,903 --> 01:12:10,082
Cheap ··!

549
01:12:29,732 --> 01:12:31,441
Nao-chan is in trouble

550
01:12:31,709 --> 01:12:34,083
If Miho gets caught in a place like this,

551
01:12:36,113 --> 01:12:38,347
This one, change it

552
01:12:38,676 --> 01:12:40,135
This is Miho

553
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:42,535
It's Miho, so take a shower

554
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:44,644
What are you really doing ...

555
01:12:49,472 --> 01:12:53,918
Tuesday 9pm

556
01:12:59,198 --> 01:13:00,300
Huh?

557
01:13:00,458 --> 01:13:02,238
What are you so surprised at?

558
01:13:02,731 --> 01:13:03,934
Miho ...

559
01:13:03,959 --> 01:13:05,895
What, why are you so surprised

560
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:06,786
no

561
01:13:06,811 --> 01:13:08,426
-Can I go in together?
- Good

562
01:13:08,451 --> 01:13:09,592
come in

563
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:13,365
Why are you so surprised?

564
01:13:14,652 --> 01:13:15,811
What?

565
01:13:15,888 --> 01:13:17,201
What happened?

566
01:13:17,234 --> 01:13:18,701
It's nothing

567
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:20,959
Then I'm glad

568
01:13:21,459 --> 01:13:22,998
What is Nao-chan doing?

569
01:13:23,023 --> 01:13:24,334
out?

570
01:13:24,771 --> 01:13:26,193
Isn't it in the room?

571
01:13:26,218 --> 01:13:27,224
like that

572
01:13:27,249 --> 01:13:28,326
Why?

573
01:13:28,475 --> 01:13:29,787
No, just···

574
01:13:35,279 --> 01:13:36,420
Strange ~?

575
01:13:36,983 --> 01:13:38,850
No, there's nothing strange

576
01:13:39,373 --> 01:13:40,623
Strange ~?

577
01:13:41,311 --> 01:13:42,771
Nothing

578
01:13:46,709 --> 01:13:48,208
- I feel good
-Yes ~

579
01:13:48,233 --> 01:13:49,686
I want to go to a hot spring

580
01:13:49,711 --> 01:13:51,193
I really want to go

581
01:13:51,218 --> 01:13:52,326
It's a hot spring ...

582
01:13:53,216 --> 01:13:54,861
It's been a while

583
01:13:55,421 --> 01:13:57,716
Should I go on vacation?

584
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:00,160
Come with me

585
01:14:00,193 --> 01:14:01,255
OK

586
01:14:05,466 --> 01:14:06,693
I feel tired?

587
01:14:06,718 --> 01:14:07,772
Huh

588
01:14:07,797 --> 01:14:09,006
okay

589
01:14:12,498 --> 01:14:13,725
Hot

590
01:14:13,750 --> 01:14:14,873
Is it hot?

591
01:14:16,037 --> 01:14:17,920
Did you soak for too long?

592
01:14:17,945 --> 01:14:19,201
- OK?
- Huh

593
01:14:19,226 --> 01:14:20,748
I must go out

594
01:14:23,708 --> 01:14:24,778
okay

595
01:14:26,052 --> 01:14:27,744
I'll go out

596
01:14:30,326 --> 01:14:31,793
Will you come with Miho more?

597
01:14:31,818 --> 01:14:32,833
Huh

598
01:15:11,857 --> 01:15:13,162
No, there it is

599
01:15:13,195 --> 01:15:14,335
Shit ~

600
01:15:39,483 --> 01:15:40,740
Nao-chan ...

601
01:15:41,271 --> 01:15:42,716
I can't

602
01:15:50,683 --> 01:15:53,020
Honey, what are you doing there?

603
01:15:53,045 --> 01:15:55,787
Oh, no, nothing

604
01:15:56,388 --> 01:15:57,615
Are you okay?

605
01:15:57,640 --> 01:16:00,107
Uh yeah, just body

606
01:16:00,349 --> 01:16:01,888
I'm brushing, I'm brushing

607
01:16:08,264 --> 01:16:09,615
Now, now, wait a minute

608
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:10,904
Let's go

609
01:16:14,014 --> 01:16:15,326
Come this way

610
01:16:16,927 --> 01:16:18,341
Come on

611
01:16:19,779 --> 01:16:21,028
Why?

612
01:16:23,522 --> 01:16:26,576
Now, you can't wait, Miho has it.

613
01:16:27,248 --> 01:16:29,943
This is really dangerous

614
01:16:34,665 --> 01:16:36,856
With such a lofty look ...

615
01:16:39,232 --> 01:16:40,724
That's hot

616
01:17:00,022 --> 01:17:01,318
I feel good

617
01:17:09,498 --> 01:17:10,826
No

618
01:18:10,031 --> 01:18:11,703
I'll lick it a lot

619
01:18:22,540 --> 01:18:25,149
Didn't you stop saying it?

620
01:18:25,174 --> 01:18:26,541
I have to punish you.

621
01:19:08,251 --> 01:19:10,384
Suck it like that

622
01:19:30,009 --> 01:19:31,400
I'll be fine ...

623
01:19:34,305 --> 01:19:35,656
I feel good

624
01:19:36,713 --> 01:19:37,961
Do you want to suck the nipples?

625
01:19:37,986 --> 01:19:39,049
Huh···

626
01:19:46,978 --> 01:19:48,845
Should I take it out

627
01:21:25,714 --> 01:21:27,451
Keep collecting like that

628
01:21:29,748 --> 01:21:31,451
It's good to touch it like that ...

629
01:21:31,670 --> 01:21:34,099
Do you feel good? It became slippery

630
01:21:43,139 --> 01:21:44,568
I feel good

631
01:21:54,639 --> 01:21:56,303
If not, then

632
01:22:16,346 --> 01:22:17,956
It's slippery

633
01:22:17,981 --> 01:22:19,284
It's slippery

634
01:22:31,536 --> 01:22:32,590
more··

635
01:22:45,903 --> 01:22:47,110
more··!

636
01:22:48,166 --> 01:22:49,549
Good mood···

637
01:23:12,323 --> 01:23:14,222
What are you going to do

638
01:23:15,074 --> 01:23:16,597
I'm embarrassed for a moment (haha)

639
01:23:16,622 --> 01:23:18,339
This posture is a bit shy

640
01:23:19,159 --> 01:23:20,354
Are you ashamed?

641
01:23:55,417 --> 01:23:56,683
No

642
01:23:56,708 --> 01:23:57,909
Where are you going?

643
01:24:18,893 --> 01:24:20,199
Wet

644
01:24:28,057 --> 01:24:29,291
Awesome

645
01:24:48,825 --> 01:24:50,018
No no

646
01:24:50,380 --> 01:24:51,878
Ashamed

647
01:24:59,097 --> 01:25:00,285
No

648
01:25:00,910 --> 01:25:02,277
Make me wash

649
01:25:18,744 --> 01:25:20,370
- it's delicious?
-It tastes good

650
01:25:54,506 --> 01:25:55,702
Quickly ...

651
01:25:55,727 --> 01:25:57,078
Do you want to suck?

652
01:26:10,528 --> 01:26:11,981
I feel good ...

653
01:26:26,130 --> 01:26:27,270
Awesome ...

654
01:26:30,091 --> 01:26:31,224
More ...

655
01:26:34,294 --> 01:26:35,458
there··!

656
01:26:48,692 --> 01:26:50,746
Like that ...

657
01:26:51,395 --> 01:26:53,528
I feel good ··! that··

658
01:27:04,937 --> 01:27:06,156
awhile··!

659
01:28:06,855 --> 01:28:08,393
Kanda ...

660
01:28:09,019 --> 01:28:10,222
Go away ...!

661
01:28:47,746 --> 01:28:48,949
Good mood

662
01:29:46,404 --> 01:29:48,013
I'm so good

663
01:29:59,420 --> 01:30:00,545
Good mood

664
01:30:10,052 --> 01:30:11,356
I feel good

665
01:30:11,614 --> 01:30:13,225
I can't stand

666
01:30:13,383 --> 01:30:14,860
I can't stand

667
01:30:26,741 --> 01:30:29,225
I feel bad

668
01:30:37,736 --> 01:30:38,884
I like it ...

669
01:30:45,915 --> 01:30:47,587
Stimulation too ...

670
01:30:56,595 --> 01:30:58,048
No more ...

671
01:31:54,811 --> 01:31:56,147
No wait

672
01:31:58,506 --> 01:32:00,771
If you move so violently ...

673
01:32:00,796 --> 01:32:01,810
What is it?

674
01:32:01,835 --> 01:32:04,116
You shouldn't be moving so violently

675
01:32:04,141 --> 01:32:05,788
Maybe it's rice?

676
01:32:06,217 --> 01:32:07,943
But it feels good!

677
01:32:09,811 --> 01:32:11,108
Violent

678
01:32:13,163 --> 01:32:15,881
If you do it violently, it will be cheap.

679
01:32:28,091 --> 01:32:29,874
It feels so good ...

680
01:32:38,124 --> 01:32:39,670
Good mood···

681
01:32:42,788 --> 01:32:44,202
Do you feel good?

682
01:32:46,819 --> 01:32:48,225
With that bridge ...

683
01:33:09,485 --> 01:33:10,798
Good mood···

684
01:33:18,023 --> 01:33:19,175
I feel good

685
01:33:19,200 --> 01:33:20,862
Something's tangled.

686
01:33:21,752 --> 01:33:23,049
Good mood···

687
01:33:27,642 --> 01:33:29,221
It's really dirty

688
01:33:34,354 --> 01:33:35,979
Then with your heart

689
01:33:44,511 --> 01:33:45,714
Is this good?

690
01:33:45,739 --> 01:33:46,956
Good···

691
01:33:53,127 --> 01:33:54,401
Do you feel good?

692
01:33:54,434 --> 01:33:55,933
The waist is arbitrary ...

693
01:33:55,958 --> 01:33:57,378
Waist moves

694
01:33:57,403 --> 01:33:58,941
Okay even if you move ...

695
01:34:32,673 --> 01:34:33,924
Do you feel good?

696
01:34:33,949 --> 01:34:36,472
Feel better ··!

697
01:34:37,517 --> 01:34:39,909
No, then it's cheap. No!

698
01:34:40,472 --> 01:34:42,972
It's okay, it's okay to be cheap!

699
01:34:43,915 --> 01:34:45,400
No, it's cheap ...!

700
01:34:54,354 --> 01:34:55,487
No

701
01:34:56,307 --> 01:34:57,730
Then you can't

702
01:35:04,574 --> 01:35:05,793
Awesome ...

703
01:35:08,605 --> 01:35:10,105
The slippery thing ...

704
01:35:10,440 --> 01:35:11,792
Is it slippery?

705
01:35:13,112 --> 01:35:14,799
Did you just feel good?

706
01:35:14,824 --> 01:35:17,160
It was good ...

707
01:35:20,597 --> 01:35:21,878
Do you want to put it?

708
01:35:21,903 --> 01:35:23,159
I want to put

709
01:35:26,925 --> 01:35:28,354
I came in

710
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:36,886
Good mood···

711
01:35:43,848 --> 01:35:45,739
It feels so good ...

712
01:35:47,004 --> 01:35:48,082
this···

713
01:35:48,348 --> 01:35:49,754
Slippery

714
01:36:00,458 --> 01:36:02,005
It's hot, it's hot

715
01:36:02,030 --> 01:36:03,082
Is it hot?

716
01:36:03,107 --> 01:36:04,840
I'll make it hotter

717
01:36:07,598 --> 01:36:08,903
Good mood···

718
01:36:09,612 --> 01:36:11,292
Where is it good?

719
01:36:11,317 --> 01:36:12,918
The pussy feels good ...

720
01:36:13,403 --> 01:36:14,668
Are you going here?

721
01:36:20,504 --> 01:36:21,660
Violent

722
01:36:28,465 --> 01:36:29,692
Good mood

723
01:36:45,356 --> 01:36:47,059
If you keep sticking there

724
01:36:47,098 --> 01:36:48,341
here?

725
01:36:49,895 --> 01:36:51,528
No go away

726
01:36:51,981 --> 01:36:53,590
Go right away

727
01:36:54,044 --> 01:36:55,489
Go away

728
01:36:58,653 --> 01:36:59,802
awhile··

729
01:37:12,622 --> 01:37:14,278
Kanda ...

730
01:37:30,856 --> 01:37:32,020
I feel good

731
01:37:35,934 --> 01:37:37,934
The nipple feels good ...

732
01:37:45,980 --> 01:37:47,542
That movement is good

733
01:37:47,739 --> 01:37:48,942
Do you feel good?

734
01:37:53,293 --> 01:37:56,192
Which sister feels better with you?

735
01:37:57,410 --> 01:37:59,020
-That's a little ...
-Which way?

736
01:37:59,934 --> 01:38:01,621
-How to do it
-Which way!

737
01:38:05,067 --> 01:38:06,427
Good mood···

738
01:38:17,722 --> 01:38:18,762
awhile··

739
01:38:23,778 --> 01:38:25,239
Kanda ... Kandaah!

740
01:38:25,411 --> 01:38:26,707
Go away!

741
01:38:51,878 --> 01:38:53,575
You're moving freely!

742
01:38:54,878 --> 01:38:56,222
I feel good ...

743
01:38:57,050 --> 01:38:58,934
Do you feel good about me?

744
01:38:58,959 --> 01:39:00,076
See you?

745
01:39:00,101 --> 01:39:01,215
Good···

746
01:39:03,575 --> 01:39:05,598
Then you can do more

747
01:39:05,918 --> 01:39:07,348
I feel good

748
01:39:07,669 --> 01:39:09,153
Is it so good?

749
01:39:10,419 --> 01:39:11,802
I love it

750
01:39:17,331 --> 01:39:18,738
I feel good ...

751
01:39:18,771 --> 01:39:19,919
good?

752
01:39:22,677 --> 01:39:23,887
Deep ...

753
01:39:26,723 --> 01:39:28,333
Do you feel good inside?

754
01:39:28,723 --> 01:39:29,888
Good mood···

755
01:39:53,309 --> 01:39:54,630
I feel good ...

756
01:39:56,996 --> 01:39:58,075
more···

757
01:40:26,278 --> 01:40:27,629
Go away ... wait

758
01:40:29,536 --> 01:40:31,129
Go away again ... Go away!

759
01:40:31,999 --> 01:40:33,069
Gandaat

760
01:40:50,671 --> 01:40:52,014
I feel good

761
01:41:07,014 --> 01:41:08,951
-Show me your ass.
-Butt?

762
01:41:47,234 --> 01:41:48,522
Good mood···

763
01:42:10,320 --> 01:42:12,101
Stick me more ...

764
01:42:12,741 --> 01:42:13,827
more··!

765
01:42:28,437 --> 01:42:30,413
Kanda ... Kanda ...

766
01:42:30,702 --> 01:42:32,085
Go away again!

767
01:43:08,319 --> 01:43:09,663
I feel good

768
01:43:14,296 --> 01:43:15,335
more···

769
01:43:16,218 --> 01:43:18,100
It feels so good ...

770
01:43:18,125 --> 01:43:19,132
Wait a minute··

771
01:43:21,796 --> 01:43:22,827
more··

772
01:43:24,546 --> 01:43:25,624
More!

773
01:43:51,155 --> 01:43:52,843
More ... more!

774
01:43:53,905 --> 01:43:54,913
more··!

775
01:43:56,264 --> 01:43:59,350
More ... x5

776
01:44:03,327 --> 01:44:05,155
If you add, it will be cheap

777
01:44:06,278 --> 01:44:07,989
It's okay

778
01:44:08,014 --> 01:44:09,077
Really?

779
01:44:09,304 --> 01:44:10,475
Come here

780
01:44:11,288 --> 01:44:12,421
Come this way

781
01:44:31,342 --> 01:44:33,099
I feel so good

782
01:44:33,842 --> 01:44:35,186
I love it ...

783
01:44:56,303 --> 01:44:57,553
Why··?

784
01:45:01,601 --> 01:45:02,647
more··!

785
01:45:02,983 --> 01:45:04,358
Don't stop

786
01:45:04,383 --> 01:45:05,429
continue··!

787
01:45:12,006 --> 01:45:13,256
I feel good

788
01:45:14,999 --> 01:45:16,546
I like it so much ...

789
01:45:24,951 --> 01:45:27,202
Kanda ... Kanda ...

790
01:45:27,648 --> 01:45:29,897
Kanda ... Kanda ... Go again!

791
01:45:44,288 --> 01:45:45,546
I feel good

792
01:46:15,482 --> 01:46:16,499
Go away

793
01:46:20,390 --> 01:46:21,452
Gandaat

794
01:46:29,577 --> 01:46:30,921
I can't do it anymore

795
01:47:09,882 --> 01:47:11,428
No go away ... go away!

796
01:47:11,453 --> 01:47:13,397
Go away ... Ganda ... Gandaat ...

797
01:47:26,320 --> 01:47:27,672
Good mood···

798
01:47:39,097 --> 01:47:40,386
I feel good

799
01:48:06,598 --> 01:48:07,653
there··

800
01:48:07,886 --> 01:48:08,981
here?

801
01:48:09,006 --> 01:48:10,137
There ...

802
01:48:21,513 --> 01:48:22,606
Goes··

803
01:48:22,731 --> 01:48:25,067
Kanda ... Kanda ...

804
01:48:32,996 --> 01:48:34,129
Good mood··!

805
01:48:44,208 --> 01:48:45,395
Quickly ...

806
01:49:16,317 --> 01:49:17,567
So good

807
01:49:46,067 --> 01:49:47,418
If it stops

808
01:49:51,419 --> 01:49:52,427
Moreover ...

809
01:50:17,565 --> 01:50:19,168
Wait ... Nadu ...

810
01:50:19,653 --> 01:50:22,676
Make her go like I did to my sister!

811
01:50:23,067 --> 01:50:24,575
More ... more!

812
01:50:28,661 --> 01:50:30,567
Kanda ... Kanda ... Kandaat!

813

815
01:51:03,323 --> 01:51:05,011
More vigorously?

816
01:51:13,438 --> 01:51:15,424
-Can you see it going in?
-I see ...

817
01:51:27,143 --> 01:51:28,463
I fell in love

818
01:51:28,488 --> 01:51:29,768
Would you like to put it in

819
01:51:35,284 --> 01:51:36,581
I see it!

820
01:52:04,224 --> 01:52:05,513
Are you going?

821
01:52:06,169 --> 01:52:07,443
Are you going to go again?

822
01:52:08,357 --> 01:52:09,544
Click here ...

823
01:52:20,685 --> 01:52:21,748
Gandat ...

824
01:52:21,919 --> 01:52:23,380
Let's go ... Go!

825
01:52:36,662 --> 01:52:37,826
Go away

826
01:53:07,300 --> 01:53:08,425
more···

827
01:53:15,963 --> 01:53:17,308
It looks like rice

828
01:53:25,581 --> 01:53:26,924
It's really good

829
01:53:43,549 --> 01:53:44,674
more··

830
01:53:51,995 --> 01:53:55,073
More ... More ... More!

831
01:53:58,853 --> 01:54:00,462
I'm gone again ...

832
01:54:00,487 --> 01:54:02,034
Go again ...

833
01:54:09,385 --> 01:54:10,737
Kanda ...

834
01:54:15,276 --> 01:54:16,323
go away··

835
01:54:16,572 --> 01:54:17,745
Go away again

836
01:54:21,050 --> 01:54:22,510
Wait ... Gandaah!

837
01:54:26,830 --> 01:54:28,073
Wait ... wait

838
01:54:36,112 --> 01:54:37,838
Go away again

839
01:55:01,768 --> 01:55:02,877
I can't

840
01:55:03,025 --> 01:55:04,244
It's going to be cold

841
01:55:06,198 --> 01:55:07,370
Cheap ··!

842
01:55:42,990 --> 01:55:44,287
No more

843
01:56:24,033 --> 01:56:25,229
Sleepy

844
01:56:30,655 --> 01:56:31,834
what?

845
01:56:31,977 --> 01:56:33,809
Is something wet?

846
01:56:34,529 --> 01:56:35,536
is it?

847
01:56:35,561 --> 01:56:36,866
Why is it so wet?

848
01:56:36,891 --> 01:56:38,779
Is it because I'm a little ill

849
01:56:40,099 --> 01:56:42,006
I have some cold sweat ...

850
01:56:42,031 --> 01:56:43,185
OK?

851
01:56:43,210 --> 01:56:44,505
Isn't it hot?

852
01:56:44,530 --> 01:56:46,115
Yes, it's hot

853
01:56:49,014 --> 01:56:50,272
Sleep fast

854
01:56:50,297 --> 01:56:51,506
okay

855
01:56:55,209 --> 01:56:56,821
Something sloppy ...

856
01:56:56,846 --> 01:56:58,834
Well, you can run the washing machine tomorrow.
