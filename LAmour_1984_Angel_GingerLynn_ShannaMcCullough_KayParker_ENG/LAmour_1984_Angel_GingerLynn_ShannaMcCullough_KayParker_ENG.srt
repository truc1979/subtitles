3
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,200
drinking buddy

4
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,450
I have to tell you got to

5
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:21,670
stop making some payments

6
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:23,890
and I saw Ellen today and...

7
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:26,770
Oh shit is Ellen bitching again?

8
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:28,150
That's there's a right to complain you're way behind

9
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:31,630
Who's side are you on anyway?

10
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:36,210
I'm on both your sides you know that

11
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,880
You still there?
Have any suggestions?

12
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,470
Yeah, yeah I have some suggestions I suggest you start making

13
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:42,919
some payments

14
00:01:43,065 --> 00:01:44,350
Believe me Jerry I am

15
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:46,660
making payments on that three-bedroom

16
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,630
house I bought, Gloria's jewelry, that that

17
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:52,960
fucking honeymoon in Europe that I couldn't even afford

18
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,910
Vince look I sympathize with your

19
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:56,590
problems but we're talking about Ellen

20
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,750
she's having a very hard financial time

21
00:01:58,750 --> 00:01:59,950
of it and you got to start doing something

22
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:02,380
I'll see what I can do

23
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:08,150
Yeah. Talk to you later

24
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:13,239
Ah that's better now we can concentrate

25
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:16,739
on some serious business

26
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,970
Oh Baby.
I hate the smell of that cigars

27
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:25,070
I'm sorry baby I'm gonna give him up one

28
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:27,520
of these days

29
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,073
How much good sir?

30
00:02:57,073 --> 00:02:57,988
Oh hi Pam

31
00:02:57,988 --> 00:02:59,001
What can I get for you today?

32
00:02:59,001 --> 00:03:00,792
How about a large iced tea?

33
00:03:00,792 --> 00:03:02,090
Anything else? How about today's special?

34
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:03,962
Yeah I'll be fine

35
00:03:03,962 --> 00:03:05,105
Okay

36
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:17,140
Did you have to show off like that?

37
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,770
I was just trying to be nice

38
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:23,160
Yeah... but not too nice

39
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:38,840
But it's easy

40
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,370
Your snap crotch

41
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:47,341
Are you lawyers don't know anything?

42
00:03:47,341 --> 00:03:48,478
Let me do it

43
00:03:52,378 --> 00:03:53,286
Can you do it?

44
00:03:53,286 --> 00:03:54,379
It's not a snap

45
00:03:54,379 --> 00:03:57,620
Yes it is

46
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:28,920
Babe, suck on here

47
00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:12,089
Brewster's residence,

48
00:08:12,089 --> 00:08:16,044
Gloria Brewster speaking

49
00:08:16,044 --> 00:08:17,669
Gloria?

50
00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:19,999
Gloria is that you? You sound funny

51
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:23,639
- Everything's all right?
- I'm fine! I'm just

52
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:25,799
waiting for you to get home I'm warming

53
00:08:25,799 --> 00:08:28,469
something up for you right now

54
00:08:28,469 --> 00:08:30,179
Don't tell me you're finally learning how to cook

55
00:08:30,179 --> 00:08:34,879
No but I do have something cooking

56
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:37,050
Well honey I'm afraid you're gonna have

57
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,789
to put it on the back burner I gotta see a client

58
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:40,979
Can't he wait?

59
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,529
I'm afraid not. What is it you got warming up?

60
00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:48,649
Hold on, I wish you'd listen to it

61
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:52,579
Did you hear me out?

62
00:08:52,579 --> 00:08:54,319
Gloria did you buy a cat?

63
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:58,240
No silly I have a pussy and it's meow

64
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:04,120
is *** harder for you

65
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,550
I swear baby if I could I'd come home right now

66
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:09,610
But I can't.
You just keep it warm for a couple of hours

67
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:11,260
and I'll get there

68
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:15,030
How about giving it a kiss over the phone?

69
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,220
See you later

70
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:24,420
Ooh that gave me goosebumps all over

71
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,630
Hurry home, okay, and do it in person

72
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:30,630
Bye

73
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:42,340
Come in my mouth

74
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:55,550
I spoke to Vince he said he'd try mixing payments

75
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:58,459
Jerry, that's what he said the

76
00:09:58,459 --> 00:10:01,450
last time and the time before that

77
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:07,040
I know. He's not a bad guy

78
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,890
And I know that. I was married him for 15 years,

79
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:12,339
remember

80
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,040
It's just I cannot make it financially

81
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,149
alone anymore

82
00:10:19,149 --> 00:10:20,829
Well. What a fun I *** ***

83
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:22,050
some money

84
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,259
Jerry you know how I feel

85
00:10:23,259 --> 00:10:25,150
about that, but thank you

86
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:29,100
Now it's time that husband of mine that

87
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:33,290
ex-husband of mine left after his

88
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:35,580
responsibilities and I think I know just

89
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:39,715
how to do it

90
00:10:39,715 --> 00:10:41,220
Oh yeah? Tell me how?

91
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,850
I think I'm gonna pack up my troubles I

92
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:47,880
move into a brand-new house. House where

93
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,890
there are more bedrooms than the current

94
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:54,445
owner can use

95
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:55,440
Ellen you don't mean you're gonna go...

96
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,000
I certainly do. Watch me:

97
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,320
honeymoon cottage here I come

98
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,410
Boy you think we'd have more ***

99
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:28,040
possessions after all this time into

100
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,939
good thing we don't own all this

101
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:32,009
furniture honey I never fit in with your

102
00:11:32,009 --> 00:11:35,279
father's *** or anyway

103
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,540
so you sure you

104
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,550
want to go through this I know we've

105
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:40,219
been through it before but...

106
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,240
All I know Mark, is

107
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,850
that we've got to do something I'm out

108
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:46,980
of a job and our bank account is zilch

109
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,589
but I can get a job, mom.

110
00:11:49,589 --> 00:11:52,529
And quit college? No honey I won't hear that

111
00:11:52,529 --> 00:11:54,420
Just for a semester or two

112
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,249
Yes and that's what I said all those

113
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:58,829
years ago I always promised myself I'd

114
00:11:58,829 --> 00:12:01,379
go back to school and I never did and I

115
00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:02,939
don't want the same thing to happen to you

116
00:12:02,939 --> 00:12:07,019
I guess dad was pretty excited when

117
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:11,219
you told him huh?

118
00:12:11,219 --> 00:12:12,410
She didn't tell him!

119
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:15,420
honey I was going to but well you you

120
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,181
know how your father is

121
00:12:18,259 --> 00:12:20,078
You should have told him

122
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:21,899
Yeah I guess you're right I should

123
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:23,120
have told him

124
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,350
Tell you what, we'll stop on the way and

125
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:28,129
I'll call him then

126
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,550
Honey go ahead and order I'll go call

127
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:50,500
your father and tell him the good news

128
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,420
ok

129
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:05,140
Hi! I don't think you're right here before

130
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,542
I just moved into the area

131
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:07,470
Oh, good, so you can get back

132
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,850
to the restaurant again

133
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,721
Could be

134
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,000
 I'm Pam Wilson, what's your name?

135
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,200
Mark. Mark Brewster

136
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,254
Brewster...

137
00:13:16,449 --> 00:13:18,279
There's a guy named Brewster comes in a lot

138
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:19,800
He drives a red convertible

139
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,650
That's my dad!

140
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,929
Me and my mom we're gonna move in with him

141
00:13:22,929 --> 00:13:25,660
Great, so you will be coming back in again

142
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:28,386
I do more than *** customers

143
00:13:29,049 --> 00:13:30,733
Can give name of *** things to stop by

144
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,156
Great, I'd like that

145
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:54,850
Well, there was nobody home so I guess

146
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:56,597
we'll just have to surprise them

147
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,755
Hi

148
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:02,613
Mom, this is Pam Wilson

149
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,510
Nice to meet you

150
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,820
Hello dear, nice to meet you too

151
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,845
What can I get you folks?

152
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,896
2 Deluxe's and 2 rough beers

153
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,196
Okay, come right up

154
00:14:12,045 --> 00:14:13,946
You couldn't get him on the phone, huh?

155
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,201
Honey I tried but nobody was home

156
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,145
Sure you dialed the right number?

157
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:22,093
Mark, after all these years I know your father's number

158
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,270
Aren't you getting a little friendly

159
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,750
with that kid over there?

160
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:28,112
Dad, give me a break

161
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,992
(Ohh...)

162
00:15:06,792 --> 00:15:10,571
(Ohh... ohh)

163
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:17,618
Oh Christ, a sec you scared the shit out of me

164
00:15:19,222 --> 00:15:21,200
Gloria you haven't been taking any

165
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,180
of those tranquilizers again, have you?

166
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,370
You know how they affect you

167
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:27,887
I want you

168
00:15:27,887 --> 00:15:28,812
Gloria!

169
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,034
Hello, anybody home?

170
00:17:24,749 --> 00:17:27,029
The good sign is door is open

171
00:17:27,659 --> 00:17:29,279
That means your father's expecting us

172
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:30,899
Honey why don't you bring the rest of

173
00:17:30,899 --> 00:17:33,800
the things in and I'll scout locations

174
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,928
They found the extra bedroom honey

175
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:21,591
yours is downstairs

176
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,860
Is Dad here?

177
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:26,150
He certainly is

178
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:29,110
But I don't think he wants to be bothered right now

179
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:31,042
So why don't you go ahead and unpack

180
00:21:31,042 --> 00:21:32,780
and I... I guess I'll go

181
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:35,045
in the kitchen start fixing supper

182
00:21:35,045 --> 00:21:36,090
Okay

183
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,961
Oh Vince that was wonderful

184
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:11,119
you're the greatest

185
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:12,691
Oh so are you baby

186
00:22:12,691 --> 00:22:14,523
So are you

187
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,892
Where did this come from?

188
00:22:42,892 --> 00:22:46,830
Oh, oh, this is lovely

189
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:48,890
I've always dreamed of having a coat like this

190
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,364
That's lovely Gloria, but

191
00:22:50,364 --> 00:22:51,659
Oh I tried to walk passed it

192
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:54,059
I did it in fact several times but it just kept

193
00:22:54,059 --> 00:22:57,691
saying to me buy me buy me buy me Gloria

194
00:22:57,691 --> 00:23:00,000
It also tell you what to use for money?

195
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,669
My Charge Card of course

196
00:23:02,069 --> 00:23:03,462
Of course

197
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:05,650
I knew you wouldn't mind

198
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:08,473
Gloria there's something we got to talk about

199
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:10,020
Of course honey but first let me

200
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,880
tell you that you're the most wonderful

201
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,800
*smack*

202
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:16,480
and generous husband a girl could ever have

203
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,640
Gloria.

204
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,590
Jerry asked me and ***

205
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,910
He's a nice guy and I know he's

206
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:22,530
your best friend but he just wouldn't

207
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:24,786
understand about such luxuries

208
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,850
Take this fur coat for instance

209
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:29,960
Oh I'd like to take that fur coat right back to the store

210
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:34,110
Vince, be serious, you know you want me to

211
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:36,093
look nice and besides

212
00:23:36,093 --> 00:23:38,870
I say that if you've got it, flaunt it

213
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:40,219
But I don't have it

214
00:23:40,219 --> 00:23:42,780
Sure you do Honey. Maybe not as big as

215
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,940
Jerry's but your little doodoo is plenty

216
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:45,800
big enough for me

217
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,740
Gloria, I'm not talking

218
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:49,020
about my little doodoo god damn it

219
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,720
I am talking about this mania you

220
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,550
have for spending every penny I make

221
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,258
Sometimes before I make it

222
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:58,600
Hi, I didn't mean to interrupt

223
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:01,049
Go ahead finish your argument I just

224
00:24:01,049 --> 00:24:02,707

225
00:24:03,174 --> 00:24:04,275
Goodbye

226
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,600
Wasn't that your ex-wife?

227
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:10,630
That was Ellen alright.

228
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:13,362
Alright help!

229
00:24:13,362 --> 00:24:14,567
What is she doing here?

230
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,870

231
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:18,344

232
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:26,225
- Mark!
- Hi dad

233
00:24:26,794 --> 00:24:28,193
Have you seen your mother?

234
00:24:28,299 --> 00:24:30,070
She's in the bedroom

235
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,043
Don't you ever knock?

236
00:24:51,045 --> 00:24:52,511
In my own house?

237
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,110
This may be your house but this is my bedroom

238
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,594
Oh since when?

239
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:57,649
Since right now

240
00:24:57,649 --> 00:24:59,667
Oh, hell it is. Get your bags and

241
00:24:59,667 --> 00:25:00,870
get out of here please

242
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,000
You throw me out on that street, Vince Brewster,

243
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:05,351
I will take you to court so fast

244
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,200
your heads gonna spin

245
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,080
The judge will award me this whole house

246
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,900
just for that child support payments

247
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,600
What's going on here?

248
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,309
Oh... it looks like we've got a border, Honey

249
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,549
Two borders.

250
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,849
My son Mark will be staying downstairs

251
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,390
Vince, get this this... this creature out of our house

252
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,095
I've already told her

253
00:25:28,095 --> 00:25:30,902
And I've already told him that we intend to stay

254
00:25:31,589 --> 00:25:33,679
We'll be one big happy family

255
00:25:33,969 --> 00:25:36,409
I'll do the cooking Gloria can do the cleaning

256
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:38,295
I don't do cleaning

257
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,402
We have a woman come in twice a week

258
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,165
Okay, I'll do the cleaning and

259
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:44,320
Gloria can do the cooking

260
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:46,646
I don't cook either

261
00:25:47,549 --> 00:25:49,240
Well what do you do, Honey?

262
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:52,710
Uh, maybe you're good at sucking cock

263
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,006
Or there's a woman coming twice a week and do that too

264
00:25:57,150 --> 00:26:00,395
Vince, do something!

265
00:26:01,665 --> 00:26:05,529
Good idea. I *** *** Mark unpack.

266
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:10,156
- Nice coat sweetie
- Vince!

267
00:26:13,156 --> 00:26:15,029
 Oh Gloria calm down

268
00:26:15,029 --> 00:26:18,111
Yeah I know all about it yes yes

269
00:26:18,259 --> 00:26:19,670
yeah we could get rid of all

270
00:26:19,675 --> 00:26:21,013
we could get Ellen out, yeah,

271
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,000
and then you know what happens

272
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:23,899
then Ellen takes Vince to

273
00:26:23,899 --> 00:26:25,399
court ends up with the house and you're

274
00:26:25,399 --> 00:26:26,511
out on the street.

275
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,000
How do I know? I'm Ellen's Lawyer

276
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,514
that's how I know honey.

277
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:34,460
But honey, listen listen I'm everybody's friend in

278
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:37,220
this, okay? I'll you know. Relax, let it go

279
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,539
for a couple days, and we'll see what

280
00:26:38,539 --> 00:26:39,799
happens. Don't worry about it.

281
00:26:40,367 --> 00:26:41,989
Jerry, if that bitch stays here I'm gonna

282
00:26:41,989 --> 00:26:43,670
make her life miserable

283
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,000
It's good to see you Mark

284
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,900
'to see you dad

285
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,000
(they talk at the same time)

286
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,510
But Mark I know that I haven't been

287
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:07,269
around to see as much as I'd like

288
00:27:07,909 --> 00:27:09,679
but the agency it's getting bigger and

289
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,244
getting married and ***...

290
00:27:11,244 --> 00:27:13,496
It's okay dad, I understand

291
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,800
That it's moving in here like this

292
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:22,202
I've tried to talk mom about it, I really did, but...

293
00:27:22,202 --> 00:27:24,358
You know how headstrong she is

294
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:27,321
Oh for Christ's sakes what's the big deal anyway

295
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:29,418
It's more than enough room in

296
00:27:29,419 --> 00:27:31,326
this house than two people need

297
00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:34,078
Mark,

298
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:36,380
you and your mom you're welcome to stay

299
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,052
here as long as you like

300
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,484
Thanks, dad

301
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,159
Finish something

302
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:57,202
Where do you want this?

303
00:27:57,202 --> 00:27:58,419
Wow, that's heavy...

304
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:04,294
Hello?

305
00:28:05,043 --> 00:28:07,015
Hi, it's me, Pam Wilson

306
00:28:07,015 --> 00:28:09,012
the girl from the diner, do you remember?

307
00:28:09,549 --> 00:28:11,316
How could I forget?

308
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:15,169
That's sweet. I've been thinking about you a lot

309
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:17,491
I've been thinking about you too.

310
00:28:17,491 --> 00:28:18,460
Really?

311
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:20,878
I have got some free time

312
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:22,922
if you'd like to come over

313
00:28:23,179 --> 00:28:25,021
Come over to your place?

314
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,652
Sounds great but what about your folks?

315
00:28:30,179 --> 00:28:34,322
No problem we'll have the place all to ourselves

316
00:28:34,809 --> 00:28:35,646
Be right over

317
00:28:35,646 --> 00:28:39,195
Great. See you then. Bye bye

318
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:46,319
You'll be right over where?

319
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:49,120
Oh I've got a date with one of the neighborhood girls

320
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,281
Wow that was a fast work

321
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:53,743
I was hoping you'd help me with the dishes

322
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,982
Hey y'all up with the dishes

323
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:58,000
No thank you, I can handle it

324
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,350
Hey, yeah yeah yeah, what the hell?

325
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:01,436
Besides we got a built-in dishwasher

326
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,671
You just go out and you have yourself a good time, son

327
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,034
Alright!

328
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,146
I've gotta take a shower and change clothes

329
00:29:08,147 --> 00:29:08,943
Thanks a lot, dad

330
00:29:08,944 --> 00:29:11,203
Make sure she uses birth control

331
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:17,410
What are you trying to do? Make points?

332
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:19,239
No no. I wasn't trying to make points

333
00:29:19,239 --> 00:29:20,000
No?

334
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:23,337
Okay, I was trying to make points

335
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:25,819
It's not too late, is it?

336
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:29,378
No, it's never too late

337
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:32,830
Oh, speaking of late, I've got to call

338
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:34,884
Jerry about our date tonight

339
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,809
Oh... so... we've got a date with Jerry

340
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:39,009
tonight huh?

341
00:29:39,109 --> 00:29:41,860
Not "we", Vince. "I". I have a date

342
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:43,690
with Jerry tonight and I've got to call

343
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:45,269
him and let him know what time

344
00:30:52,779 --> 00:30:54,618
Hi Mark. Good to see you. Come on in.

345
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,460
Good to see too. You look great

346
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,370
Come on in the bedroom

347
00:30:58,370 --> 00:30:59,942
Just *** *** on top

348
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,582
Sit down

349
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:11,232
So what do you want to talk about?

350
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,430
How about sex?

351
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,766
You mean *** right now?

352
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:19,400
No silly! I don't want to have sex now

353
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:21,321
I just want to talk about it

354
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,770
Are you still a virgin?

355
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:26,950
What a dumb question. Do I look like a virgin?

356
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,867
I don't know

357
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:30,876
You're a virgin?

358
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:32,300
Of course not!

359
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,536
Do I look retarded or something?

360
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,382
I'll bet you still have your cherry

361
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,477
Guys don't have cherries

362
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,601
No... they have something better

363
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:51,122
Before you came I was dancing

364
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,800
Would you like to see me dance?

365
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,033
Yeah, sure.

366
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:37,885
***?

367
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,885
Take off your pants

368
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:16,550
Have you ever seen a girl's pussy up close?

369
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:18,174
Only in pictures

370
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,050
It's okay. Come on.

371
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:27,658
Take a look

372
00:33:29,669 --> 00:33:31,532
It's okay. Go ahead.

373
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:36,209
Look it. Kiss it.

374
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,546
Yeah, like that.

375
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:41,360
Good enough to eat?

376
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,245
Yeah

377
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:57,782
That's good

378
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:30,731
Way back I wanna pee first

379
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:34,350
Wait a minute, I'm not into that kinky stuff

380
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:37,186
Silly! Not on you! In toilets.

381
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,455
***, come with me

382
00:34:38,455 --> 00:34:39,455
Okay

383
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,217
I thought you had to go pee

384
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:55,300
I don't

385
00:34:56,979 --> 00:35:00,127
I *** *** do it on my bed, you know

386
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,711
Okay

387
00:35:07,886 --> 00:35:10,399
Come here, *** *** ***

388
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:19,308
I want your cock in my pussy

389
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,468
Let's go to bedroom

390
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:25,250
No, I don't want to wait. Still right here.

391
00:37:09,949 --> 00:37:11,159
What's that noise?

392
00:37:11,459 --> 00:37:13,553
*** *** it

393
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:35,328
Pam? Where the hell are you?

394
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,150
What was that?

395
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:41,739
Oh my god it's my dad

396
00:38:41,739 --> 00:38:44,485
*** you. Oh no, we don't have time, it's too late

397
00:38:44,485 --> 00:38:46,504
Come in here. Hurry, hurry

398
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:56,477
It's kind of surprise that you called tonight

399
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,605
It was kind of short notice, I'm sorry

400
00:39:58,610 --> 00:39:59,835
Hey, no, that's okay

401
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,943
You can call me anytime

402
00:40:03,969 --> 00:40:06,079
Is this social or business?

403
00:40:07,209 --> 00:40:08,648
Strictly social

404
00:40:09,205 --> 00:40:12,090
It's been a long time since we've seen each other

405
00:40:13,709 --> 00:40:14,675
It's probably nice to get

406
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,191
out of the house too

407
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:18,411
Does it show?

408
00:40:18,845 --> 00:40:19,900
No and I could imagine that

409
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,460
your first day at the Brewster's could

410
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,582
be a little trying

411
00:40:23,459 --> 00:40:24,730
Actually it hasn't been that bad

412
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:27,757
Vince is handling this whole thing very well

413
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,650
What does Vince have to complain about?

414
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,821
He's got two wives one cooks the other fucks

415
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:38,500
I'm sorry

416
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:44,005
it's okay. It's the truth

417
00:40:44,505 --> 00:40:45,950
Gloria thinks I moved in to 

418
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:48,000
steal Vince away from her

419
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:51,136
And she's right?

420
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,297
I don't think so

421
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,020
Did you call me tonight to prove to

422
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,931
Gloria that you weren't after Vince?

423
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:03,445
That's part of it. Are you angry with me?

424
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:05,270
No no, that's what I'm on earth for: to be

425
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:08,750
abused by beautiful women

426
00:41:08,810 --> 00:41:09,945
What's the rest of it?

427
00:41:10,505 --> 00:41:12,239
The other part of it is that I wanted

428
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:14,801
to be with somebody that I care a lot about

429
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,328
I feel comfortable with

430
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,152
So do you want to fuck?

431
00:44:22,569 --> 00:44:24,408
Thanks I needed it

432
00:44:24,604 --> 00:44:27,140
Thank you

433
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:31,150
Remember the first time you made love?

434
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:34,255
Yeah, you haven't ***

435
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:38,720
Force of habit

436
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,412
You're thinking of him now?

437
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:44,747
You really want to know?

438
00:44:44,747 --> 00:44:46,180
Sure

439
00:44:46,525 --> 00:44:48,589
He never entered my mind once

440
00:44:48,589 --> 00:44:53,602
Vince *** is through. Done. Kaput.

441
00:44:53,602 --> 00:44:55,418
You're still crazy about him

442
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:58,208
It's sure I am.

443
00:45:02,508 --> 00:45:03,844
Stupid.

444
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:08,716
Hey look, Vince,

445
00:45:08,717 --> 00:45:11,110
it's about last night with your ex-wife

446
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:14,006
Oh yeah,

447
00:45:14,006 --> 00:45:16,263
You did do her the last night, didn't you?

448
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:18,532
Have any fun?

449
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:19,890
Of course no,

450
00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:20,940
What kind of fun could I have with a

451
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:23,440
beautiful woman like Ellen?

452
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,110
You're still in love with her, right?

453
00:45:25,110 --> 00:45:29,005
Me? Interested in Ellen? Don't be ridiculous

454
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:30,660
Okay so you don't mind me going out

455
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:32,107
with her, doing things with her?

456
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:34,200
Doing things with her?

457
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:36,659
No, of course not, Jerry

458
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:38,916
Good. I'm relieved to hear it

459
00:45:40,229 --> 00:45:41,779
I sure if we talk

460
00:45:41,869 --> 00:45:43,951
*** this afternoon if you want

461
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:45,619
I've got a better idea

462
00:45:45,619 --> 00:45:47,778
You remember that old bar we used to go

463
00:45:47,779 --> 00:45:49,256
to down by the beach?

464
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:52,000
Why don't we meet there say about seven o'clock?

465
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:52,794
Okay great

466
00:45:52,794 --> 00:45:54,349
be just like old times, two of us

467
00:45:54,349 --> 00:45:56,368
together, owling at the moon

468
00:45:57,809 --> 00:46:00,340
Alright, I'll see you then

469
00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:35,360
Thought I'd take a deep

470
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:36,744
Go ahead

471
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,220
Water is great. You should try it

472
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:35,329
No thanks. I can't swim

473
00:47:35,550 --> 00:47:37,480
Oh well, in that case you should let me

474
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,623
teach you. Come on.

475
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:41,162
No

476
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:43,270
You don't trust me

477
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:47,860
Should I? If I drowned you'd have a clear

478
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:49,563
field with Vince

479
00:47:49,565 --> 00:47:50,950
You know something?

480
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,881
You're absolutely right

481
00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:53,960
Huh?

482
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:59,019
You and I, alone, here. All I have to do is

483
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:03,180
give you a push, into the water you go.

484
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:05,499
You'd swallow so much water you just be

485
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:08,169
gasping and kicking around you'd drown

486
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:09,633
like a rat

487
00:48:12,115 --> 00:48:13,150
Don't worry sweetie,

488
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:16,059
I wouldn't dampen a single golden hair on

489
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:18,178
your precious head

490
00:48:22,166 --> 00:48:22,978
ah

491
00:48:28,008 --> 00:48:29,979
Come on, grab me.

492
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:45,514
Oh, it's okay sweetie

493
00:48:45,514 --> 00:48:46,666
Sit down

494
00:48:57,710 --> 00:48:59,948
Come on, let's go inside the house

495
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:15,027
Oh

496
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:21,336
I'll be alright

497
00:49:21,336 --> 00:49:23,139
Yes I know you will

498
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:25,458
Shut up while I try *** here

499
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,000
Why are you doing this?

500
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,503
Because you're wet

501
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:35,464
If you don't dry you off

502
00:49:35,465 --> 00:49:36,649
you catch pneumonia and then

503
00:49:36,650 --> 00:49:39,028
I'll be stuck taking care of you

504
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,932
You saved my life

505
00:49:53,329 --> 00:49:55,820
I think nothing of it

506
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:58,009
If it wasn't for me you've never fallen into

507
00:49:58,010 --> 00:50:00,750
the swimming pool in the first place

508
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:05,460
Thank you

509
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:08,670
I'm sorry I guess I shouldn't have done that

510
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:12,150
I just wanted to thank you

511
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:24,000
What you say is a sad story Vince

512
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,624
*** got both the girls in the house

513
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:30,390
Just one big and happy family

514
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:35,463
I know. What am I gonna do?

515
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:39,250
I don't know Vince

516
00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:41,556
I *** you gonna do

517
00:54:44,930 --> 00:54:46,950
I don't know, I'm asking you

518
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:48,574
I listen but...

519
00:54:48,574 --> 00:54:51,728
I'm a lawyer not a marriage counselor

520
00:54:52,430 --> 00:54:53,800
I'll drink to that

521
00:54:54,119 --> 00:54:57,408
- Let's drink ***
- I'll drink to that

522
00:55:02,633 --> 00:55:04,100
You know something pal?

523
00:55:04,819 --> 00:55:06,170
What's about buddy?

524
00:55:07,410 --> 00:55:10,627
I have discovered something very important

525
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:15,550
Hey Vince, tell me something

526
00:55:15,550 --> 00:55:16,230
Yeah

527
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:18,134
What is it you discovered so very important?

528
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:20,294
What's that?

529
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:24,371
Vince, you said you discovered something important

530
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:25,685
Oh yeah

531
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:29,784
I discovered that women are basically all alike

532
00:55:29,785 --> 00:55:31,460
I have known that for years

533
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:34,113
and then they all got tits and pussy

534
00:55:34,490 --> 00:55:37,287
There's more women than just tits and pussies, pal

535
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,601
You *** kinky I wanna guess

536
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,231
Take those two for example

537
00:55:44,431 --> 00:55:46,068
Oh man if I do

538
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:50,606
So female

539
00:55:51,790 --> 00:55:54,675
Why can't women be a little more like men, huh?

540
00:55:57,290 --> 00:55:58,906
I don't know Vince

541
00:56:03,598 --> 00:56:05,381
***

542
00:56:07,381 --> 00:56:11,053
- Hey
- Yes, we are

543
00:56:12,053 --> 00:56:13,768
Mind if we are joining you?

544
00:56:13,768 --> 00:56:15,359
Hey, why? We found a ***?

545
00:56:16,359 --> 00:56:18,353
Come on, sit down here

546
00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:22,999
I couldn't help to hear your discussion about women

547
00:56:23,250 --> 00:56:26,381
*** found it quite fascinating

548
00:56:26,999 --> 00:56:28,500
Can we talk about you to ***?

549
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:29,499
That's right

550
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:35,023
Well, ***

551
00:56:36,053 --> 00:56:37,340
Tell us something,

552
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:39,350
my buddy here says he thinks all women are

553
00:56:39,350 --> 00:56:41,800
alike. What do you think about that?

554
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:45,560
Well, look around, I must guarantee there's not

555
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:48,365
another woman in the place like me, don't you think?

556
00:56:48,365 --> 00:56:49,712
Yeah

557
00:56:49,712 --> 00:56:51,336
I could be wrong

558
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:56,510
Why don't you guys come over to our place

559
00:56:56,510 --> 00:56:58,961
for a little adventure?

560
00:57:00,061 --> 00:57:01,445
What do you say Vince?

561
00:57:01,650 --> 00:57:03,344
Now, I have nothing to do

562
00:57:24,130 --> 00:57:27,261
- This is the life, no?
- Yep

563
00:57:28,359 --> 00:57:30,843
No worries at all

564
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:34,883
Yeah, no wife, no ex-wife

565
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:37,882
Pretty good, huh, Vince?

566
00:57:37,890 --> 00:57:39,123
Oh yeah

567
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:41,760
Of course you know Gloria

568
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,976
is no slouch in the cocksucking

569
00:57:43,976 --> 00:57:45,521
- ***
- That's true

570
00:57:48,029 --> 00:57:50,178
What do you mean "that's true"? How would you know?

571
00:57:51,529 --> 00:57:53,325
I *** *** before you did

572
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:55,750
Oh yeah, that's right

573
00:58:02,869 --> 00:58:04,130
Ellen's pretty good too

574
00:58:04,130 --> 00:58:05,261
That's right

575
00:58:05,874 --> 00:58:08,597
How would you rate her on a scale of 1 to 10?

576
00:58:09,719 --> 00:58:14,858
Hmm... I guess I'd say

577
00:58:14,859 --> 00:58:17,500
about seven and three-quarters

578
00:58:18,570 --> 00:58:21,000
Seven and three quarters, huh?

579
00:58:22,405 --> 00:58:23,681
That's all?

580
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:26,625
That's as far as my measuring stick goes

581
01:00:11,829 --> 01:00:16,329
Now boys, let's have some real fun

582
01:00:24,529 --> 01:00:26,397
No way

583
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:40,263
- ***
- ***

584
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,900
I really appreciate... this... this...

585
01:00:57,900 --> 01:00:59,339
It's ok, buddy?

586
01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:01,313
You're in no condition to drive

587
01:01:02,389 --> 01:01:05,522
Okay, *** in the couch. Bye

588
01:01:05,522 --> 01:01:07,797
Hey hey hey, wait a minute

589
01:01:07,797 --> 01:01:10,448
This is a three bedrooms house

590
01:01:10,848 --> 01:01:13,500
Oh yeah, well...

591
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:15,240
Gloria and I sleep one of the bedrooms

592
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:18,569
You wouldn't want to sleep with Gloria

593
01:01:18,569 --> 01:01:20,411
and me would you?

594
01:01:20,524 --> 01:01:21,959
No offense pal, but I

595
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:24,202
have no desire to sleep with you

596
01:01:25,079 --> 01:01:27,680
I've my son Mark, he's sleeping in the other bedroom

597
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:30,415
You wouldn't sleep with Mark, would you?

598
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:31,980
Not if there's any other choice

599
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:33,672
Well I have

600
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:38,846
You're forgetting something

601
01:01:39,105 --> 01:01:41,220
Forgetting something, What I forget?

602
01:01:41,220 --> 01:01:42,999
The third bedroom

603
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:48,381
Oh yeah, well, Ellen's sleeping in the third bedroom

604
01:01:48,381 --> 01:01:49,600
Exactly it

605
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:52,359
No no, you can't sleep there

606
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,596
Why not? You've done a hundred times

607
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:57,512
She's my wife

608
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:00,181
That's ***

609
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:03,472
I happen to be a lawyer and she happens to be your ex-wife

610
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:05,500
and I guess they wouldn't hit fucking ex-wife

611
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:07,811
in a world that I have fucked 100

612
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:14,687
Okay you can sleep with Ellen

613
01:02:15,298 --> 01:02:16,966
You can't fuck her

614
01:02:17,966 --> 01:02:19,097
Why not?

615
01:02:19,930 --> 01:02:22,351
I'm still in love with her

616
01:02:22,830 --> 01:02:25,305
Yeah? I see

617
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:29,208
- And you can't fuck Gloria
- Why?

618
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,738
'Cause I'm in love with her

619
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,740
Alright that's okay pal, we got a deal

620
01:02:35,740 --> 01:02:36,931
- Okay
- Okay

621
01:02:36,931 --> 01:02:38,872
- Shhh

622
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:16,170
Gloria

623
01:04:17,950 --> 01:04:21,036
Gloria

624
01:04:27,805 --> 01:04:31,616
Gloria? Are you alright?

625
01:04:32,890 --> 01:04:35,533
Oh I feel wonderful

626
01:04:36,235 --> 01:04:38,000
Oh shit you haven't been taking

627
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,700
those tranquilizers again, have you?

628
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:45,361
I had to. I was too excited to sleep

629
01:04:45,901 --> 01:04:47,827
You know how they affect you

630
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,285
"Excited". What do you mean "excited"?

631
01:04:52,222 --> 01:04:54,933
About Ellen being here

632
01:04:54,965 --> 01:04:57,172
Yeah well we'll talk about that in the morning

633
01:04:57,700 --> 01:05:00,340
She saved my life

634
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:02,815
That's nice

635
01:05:02,850 --> 01:05:04,510
I was going down for the third

636
01:05:04,510 --> 01:05:08,960
time and then she pulled me out

637
01:05:10,119 --> 01:05:12,579
And then we came up here and we both

638
01:05:12,579 --> 01:05:15,945
went down three times

639
01:05:16,744 --> 01:05:17,890
Good night Gloria

640
01:05:17,890 --> 01:05:20,193
Good night sweetheart

641
01:05:22,890 --> 01:05:25,843
Pills. Always taking pills

642
01:05:29,380 --> 01:05:31,089
I'm sorry Mark, I didn't know my dad was

643
01:05:31,089 --> 01:05:32,114
gonna be home tonight too

644
01:05:32,114 --> 01:05:34,800
No, it's okay. It's better here anyway

645
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:36,305
we won't be interrupted

646
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:39,182
Just be real quiet

647
01:05:39,250 --> 01:05:41,213
- I don't want to wake up anybody
- Ok

648
01:05:49,889 --> 01:05:51,200
***, give me a break

649
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:52,725
Kick you pants off, come on

650
01:05:52,985 --> 01:05:54,954
Hurry up, I'm all ready

651
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:57,547
Why you hurry, we've got all night

652
01:05:57,700 --> 01:05:59,748
We do. Alright.

653
01:06:03,780 --> 01:06:05,160
Come here

654
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:25,826
Do I look nice?

655
01:06:42,610 --> 01:06:44,895
You like that?

656
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:49,086
I do some work?

657
01:07:58,780 --> 01:08:00,293
Are you alright?

658
01:08:00,293 --> 01:08:03,233
Yeah I just have to go to the bathroom

659
01:08:03,540 --> 01:08:06,273
Are you back

660
01:09:13,490 --> 01:09:15,500
Wait, I gotta go to bathroom first

661
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:16,798
What again?

662
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:18,564
You know how I am

663
01:09:20,690 --> 01:09:22,300
Just remember where we left off, okay?

664
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:24,820
- Yeah right
- I'll be right back

665
01:09:34,869 --> 01:09:37,009
Oh, what was that?

666
01:09:46,190 --> 01:09:49,250
Hey I told you I remembered where we left off

667
01:10:09,309 --> 01:10:11,860
You know Vince, I'm sorry about calling

668
01:10:11,860 --> 01:10:14,800
this a little doodoo. Actually it's a very

669
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:17,212
nice big doodoo

670
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:24,790
Oh peace say Gloria... Stop wandering

671
01:11:24,790 --> 01:11:27,831
around and come on back to bed

672
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:31,283
Gloria

673
01:11:47,370 --> 01:11:50,370
Ah, that's how I like it

674
01:14:53,140 --> 01:14:55,277
It's great baby...

675
01:14:56,550 --> 01:15:01,421
You're the best

676
01:15:05,570 --> 01:15:07,151
Where have you been?

677
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:09,256
You won't believe me if I told you

678
01:15:12,150 --> 01:15:14,000
What are you doing?

679
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,940
It's getting late, I've to go home

680
01:15:15,940 --> 01:15:17,472
Oh ***

681
01:15:17,472 --> 01:15:19,103
Oh I know...

682
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,189
We'll just have to do it some other time

683
01:15:23,789 --> 01:15:25,556
Oh damn

684
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:31,183
Come on, I'll take you home

685
01:15:41,050 --> 01:15:44,941
- Yeah, good morning
- Good morning

686
01:15:47,550 --> 01:15:49,314
Hey Sugar

687
01:15:49,829 --> 01:15:52,808
Why are you doing here? Where's Vince?

688
01:15:53,609 --> 01:15:55,190
Vince just left for work

689
01:15:56,150 --> 01:15:57,704
I feel so miserable Jerry

690
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,642
You shouldn't, baby. Take *** happy with that

691
01:16:01,110 --> 01:16:04,424
I thought so too but I'm just kidding myself

692
01:16:04,859 --> 01:16:08,014
He's a wonderful guy, he's a marvelous husband...

693
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:11,196
Hey you know something else: he's my best friend

694
01:16:12,370 --> 01:16:13,940
But Jerry...

695
01:16:13,940 --> 01:16:17,340
I don't love him... I love you, I should

696
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:18,365
have married you

697
01:16:19,070 --> 01:16:22,260
Hey sweetheart, you didn't married me,

698
01:16:22,260 --> 01:16:24,480
you married Vince. And you better get the

699
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:25,980
hell out of this room we'll talk about

700
01:16:25,980 --> 01:16:32,329
this... ***... more rational moment

701
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,227
- Come on go out
- No

702
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,809
Rough night?

703
01:18:40,809 --> 01:18:43,251
Huh yeah, what I can remember of it

704
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:48,643
Jerry's still upstairs in bed

705
01:18:49,350 --> 01:18:52,079
Yeah, guess I'll let him sleep it off

706
01:18:52,079 --> 01:18:55,490
He might be. Generous of you

707
01:18:55,555 --> 01:18:57,302
Yeah look, I'm sorry about that

708
01:18:58,410 --> 01:18:59,643
It was his idea

709
01:18:59,900 --> 01:19:02,664
I wanted to sack out in the couch

710
01:19:04,210 --> 01:19:05,830
I didn't even know he was in bed with me

711
01:19:05,830 --> 01:19:08,200
Is Gloria up here?

712
01:19:08,200 --> 01:19:09,240
Oh yes

713
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:11,280
Where's Mark?

714
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:12,969
Oh he left already

715
01:19:12,969 --> 01:19:14,433
He said he had an appointment

716
01:19:14,433 --> 01:19:15,520
I think he has a girlfriend

717
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:16,848
Oh...

718
01:19:19,420 --> 01:19:21,000
Just like old times, isn't it?

719
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,822
Not quite like old times, Vince

720
01:19:23,900 --> 01:19:26,185
Back in those days we never knew where

721
01:19:26,185 --> 01:19:28,075
our next meal was coming from

722
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,560
Yeah. We were happy

723
01:19:33,190 --> 01:19:34,777
We were happy, don't we Ellen?

724
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,774
Yeah, I thought so

725
01:19:39,045 --> 01:19:41,133
Where'd we go wrong?

726
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,794
We didn't go wrong. I was the one who went wrong

727
01:19:45,830 --> 01:19:50,222
I was a bossy nagging wife

728
01:19:55,140 --> 01:19:58,391
You are gonna tell me I'm wrong don't you?

729
01:19:58,391 --> 01:20:03,117
No. You are bossy nagging wife

730
01:20:03,300 --> 01:20:05,530
But it's what I needed

731
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,968
you gave me the boost that I needed Ellen

732
01:20:08,610 --> 01:20:11,897
Yeah, I gave you a boost right into another woman's arms

733
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:17,165
I guess I hurt you more than I should have

734
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,606
Yeah, you shouldn't have hurt me so much

735
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,484
That's okay, I got over it

736
01:20:25,484 --> 01:20:27,582
Did you?

737
01:20:30,969 --> 01:20:33,149
You'd better go to work

738
01:20:36,330 --> 01:20:38,001
Okay

739
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:44,613
Hello?

740
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,993
