2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Welcome to the 25th Daytona 500 championship

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Today, we're going to see some of the most famous car drivers

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The weather is perfect

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Driving their car, there are BJ Turkel, Tony Benito, Bobby Hicks, Tommy Sweet

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
all of them came here to win the most prestigious car racing trophy

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
There is a really interesting human element on the track today

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
BJ Turkel and Bobby Hicks are friends since their childhood. They're fighting for the first place for years

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
bu they are still the best friends of the world

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
This friendly fight will make today's race even more spicy

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Waow, Ladies and Gentlemen, we were going right to a disaster

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
There is only one lap to go. Turkel and Hicks are fighting for the 1st place

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
A few miles from the arrival line, the head of the race is hold by Turkel, Hicks and Benito

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Woaw, Turkel just hit Hicks' car

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The crash was terrible. Are the drivers still alive?

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The referees are around the track waving yellow flags to pause the race

17
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm sorry

18
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Nooooo

19
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Well, please listen

20
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
The reason why I'm doing this conference is...

21
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
First of all, I think I've to thanks the doctors who really took care of me

22
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Thanks to them, I could soon leave this hospital

23
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
But the real reason II asked you to come here, is to tell you one thing

24
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Some days ago, while the Daytona 500,

25
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
because of a driving error I did while the race,

26
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
My teammate and childhood friend, Bobby Hicks, has been killed

27
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
For this reason, and following my doctors advices,

28
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I declare that from this day, I've decided to stop car races

29
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Thanks for your attention

30
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Try to regulate the gas pipe

31
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm sure it will start easily

32
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I don't understand. I was pretty sure it was a gas pipe issue

33
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
No, loose contact. A groundling wire problem. Try now.

34
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
- I tell you it's the gas pipe
- Stop talking, and start the engine

35
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
- So what can I do now? I shoud check the gas pipe? <i>(laughs)</i>

36
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
- Don't laugh at me. It could have been the reason!

37
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
- BJ Turkel, I have to tak with you. I  private please.

38
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
- This way

39
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
- I was going to go out a few minutes for a meal
- Don't hurry, if you know what I mean
- Understood

40
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
- You look nervous. What happened?
- Don't act as you don't know. The trouble is you don't love me anymore

41
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
- No way, I'm crazy loving you

42
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
What would you say if I put my lips here?

43
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
and let them slide slowly 'til here?

44
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
What should I do to deserve this?

45
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You just have to drive me to Naul Woods tonight.

46
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Well...

47
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
If I agree, what would I get?

48
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'll swallow.

49
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
- Do you need something?
- I've just heard on the radio that a storm is coming.

50
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
- Yeah, looks like. I think you wanna close early today?

51
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
- Right

52
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Good bye BJ, see you soon

53
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Hey, BJ, I guess you don't care but I have to say: for me, you are the greatest
Have fun!

54
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
If it's you who say it, it's a great compliment

55
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Don't worry anymore about this police helicopter. It's out of sight now.

56
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
However, we should change the place where we planned to meet.

57
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
From what I know, and what my informers know, there are plenty of cops there.

58
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
But I've found a really quite place, near Burbank

59
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Turn North-East, direction 120.4, manage to get the permission to land. Over.

60
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Roger. Warn our informer. He should arrive within 10 minuted. Over.

61
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
He's on the way. Your call Tony. Over.

62
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Flight 8674 Yankee to control tower

63
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
We ask for permission to land: we are out of fuel. Over.

64
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
- Roger. You're allowed to land. Over.
- Thanks control tower.

65
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
We're going to land smoothlessly.

66
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
- What are you watching?

67
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
- You've disappeared for 8 days. May I have an explanation?

68
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Ok, first: I do what I want, when I want. I don't need to explain anything.

69
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Second; I just came back with a load.

70
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I have 10 more kg hidden in the plane

71
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Once I sold it, I will retire on a desert island on the other side of Earth

72
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
If you don't wanna travel, it's your business

73
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
but right now, what are you waiting for to get down on your knees

74
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
and show me what a real housewife should do?

75
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I said "now". I don't have the entire day. Down on your knees, hurry-up!

76
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Don't worry about my balls. Just suck the stick.

77
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Yes, go ahead, with the tip of your lips...

78
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
That's it, lick the tip of my cock. Perfect.
Don't stop.

79
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Ok stand up. Take off your pantie and put your ass on the table.

80
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
- More quickly! Hurry-up!
- I'm ready

81
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
...I will explain you

82
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Lay down.

83
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
It was great

84
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
- You should have terminated 2 hours ago

85
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
- I'm sorry darling, but I can't go back home before I've finished this job

86
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
It's always like that

87
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Fuck. Get me a socket of 15 on the ratchet please.

88
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
- Here you are
- Thanks

89
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Actually, I know one way to let you release this...

90
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
...this 15mm socket on...

91
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Relax... Take a book, it's almost done.

92
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
What are you doing?

93
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Tell me! Won't you do that again?

94
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Well, if it makes you please...

95
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Oh my love, yes...

96
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Oh yeah, you kill me...

97
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Cum, cum on me

98
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Tonight, we're going to celebrate not only one pilot, but two.

99
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Now, let me introduce the greatest champion of the last 10 years: BJ Turkle!

100
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
BJ, congratulations

101
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Well, beyond everything else,

102
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I'd like to thanks the professional drivers associations

103
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I'd also like to thank Jim Raines, my chief engineer who always did the best to make my car ready for the beginning of the races

104
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
I'd like to thanks Quickie, the charming blonde fairy of the team

105
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
A big thank to my girlfriend, who could bear me all these years

106
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I'd also like to thank Paul Rocket.
Everybody knows he build the fastest cars

107
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I wouldn't be here without his help.

108
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
They gave me the best cars, and I only had to drive them the best I can

109
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
I think it's all I wanted to say, thank you all!
This trophy fulfill my heart

110
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
You're still the greatest BJ

111
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
We make this ceremony every year to celebrate the winner of the national championship

112
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
and this is the first time since this championship exists

113
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
that a driver is such on the top that he's never been defeated

114
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Please applause our championship winne: Tony Benito!

115
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
This is unbelievable, whatever I do, I'm always after this pathetic BJ Turkle

116
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
the greatest chicken of the last 10 years. The party is over!

117
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Why don't you tell them why you stopped driving?

118
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000
It's not because Bobby Hicks has died. It's only because you couldn't defeat me.
So stop to hide a be a man:

119
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
One race. You and me. I call you tonight and we choose the time and the place

120
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,000
and about this trophy, may I ask you to put it in your ass.

121
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Well, let's review the checkilist one last time

122
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Ok, boss

123
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Eeh, electronic starting system?

124
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
It's done since one hour, boss

125
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Turbo supply circuit?

126
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Done since a long time, boss

127
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Just check the shock absorbers and close your mouth

128
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
- Roger, boss
- Stop call me "boss". Have you retighten the fixings of exhaust pipe?

129
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
- Yes, two times
- Perfect

130
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Well, so what about the suspensions?

131
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
The right one is already done. About the left one

132
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I only need a fistful of seconds, boss

133
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Boss, boss, boss boss boss...

134
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
You'll never stop to call me "boss" when at job?

135
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
You know I hate that though

136
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I think it's enough for today. I'm done.

137
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Do you know that though I've prepared so many Porshes, I've never rid one

138
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
- Even while I wasn't watching you?
- No, never.

139
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
You've never been fucked on a Porsh hood?

140
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
You want to try this experience, Beauty?

141
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Quite interested...

142
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,000
I know what you like... you like to be made out

143
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Wait Beauty... you won't need this

144
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Go ahead Beauty, cum

145
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,000
End of the first act...

146
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Now your turn

147
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Go on Beauty, lean on the hood of the car

148
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,000
I wll finish you

149
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,000
I've heard your speech on TV. You're really unbelievable.

150
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
I'd really like to know why you speak like an old chicken

151
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
From outside, you look like an asshole

152
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
If you wanna know I'll tell you what makes me happy

153
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:27,000
first, I leave the country with 6 millions dollars and I stop my career

154
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,000
second, I finally have the opportunity to show to myself, to this old fucked Turkel,

155
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,000
and to the rest of the world who is the best driver of the world

156
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:39,000
and third, you'll see that's especially concern you

157
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,000
I've hire a prostitute who's going to come here to learn you how to fuck

158
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,000
- No way
- No "no way". Not only you'll stay here, but you'll also enjoy it

159
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,000
If you don't, you won't be able to know where I will be from next Sunday

160
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,000
You have 2 minutes to make your decision. I'm going to make a phone call.

161
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Hello?

162
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,000
- By what right you allow yourself to call me home?
- It's alright, you'll play me sugary another day

163
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,000
I called to settle the details of the race as promised.

164
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,000
So go tell your little inflated boyfriend that I expect tomorrow at 4pm on the road, behind the shack Rocket.

165
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,000
No horns, no audience, his losers team and that's all.

166
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,000
You understood well? Then ensure he has the message.

167
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,000
- Do not you dare talk to me like that there.
- No need to play the stars

168
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,000
You're a dirty little sausage <i>(means: ugly)</i>

169
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Fuck you, egg head.

170
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Darling!

171
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,000
What are we supposed to do now?

172
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,000
oh, (keep our cool ...), in your opinion? play dinette? Hey, you, what's your name?

173
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,000
- For customers this is Jenna.
- Well, do me a favor, kiss her, caress her, do what you want

174
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,000
but not just sit there doing nothing.

175
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,000
And you ... like that

176
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Yeah, it starts to please me ...

177
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Some damn entertainment, I don't have time! Up for the show torrid, not stop.

178
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Go on, go on.

179
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Do not act, I see that you like that. You love that.

180
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,000
I can see your nipples that are just hard.

181
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,000
So no lies, huh.

182
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Come on, caress her breasts at the same time.

183
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Yeah, continue.

184
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:37,000
You will not keep your clothes! Remove that, hurry up!

185
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:47,000
I want to see you naked.

186
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,000
- Come on, hurry, hurry!
- I do, a moment!

187
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Remove everything.

188
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Hurry, the bra, panties, furry!

189
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,000
It is not possible to be so slow! We will not spend Christmas Eve!

190
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:19,000
- Come on, let me see your pussy Daphne!
- Jenna!
- I do not care, let me see your beard!

191
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Yeah, and now lick it.

192
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Come on girls, you're quite amused, my turn.
Hurry! Hurry!

193
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Ooh, both together

194
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Come on.

195
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:51,000
You, come here.

196
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:02,000
I want you to lick my pussy me.

197
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:45,000
I'm going to come at you ...

198
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,000
You, pick your clothes and go away from my home.

199
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:35,000
You will have a shower. I do not want you to stain my couch.

200
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:03,000
My darling, I hope you ain't angry.

201
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Frankly it is not so serious that that I can no longer run after
all...

202
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Understand me, the death of Bobby really was the end for me.

203
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:16,000
I swore I never will drive fast and I will keep my promise.

204
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Listen to me baby, that's what we'll do:

205
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:32,000
I'll call Jim, Paul, and Quickie and I will ask them

206
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:36,000
prepare a car for tomorrow afternoon.

207
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,000
When I think that this junk called you a cheesy and me skein

208
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
But it's up to you.

209
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Before calling, I'll make love to you like I've never done

210
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:54,000
And if tomorrow you do not want to fight him, that's your business.

211
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:58,000
But you remember what you always say:

212
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:02,000
we must never let down his friends.

213
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,000
It's true that this is my case.

214
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:10,000
And you know I can not let this Benito tells you
skein and my losers friends

215
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:16,000
But you see, it was not really the most important statement.

216
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:21,000
You said ... what..? you'll make me love like you've never done?

217
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:17,000
C'mon my beautiful ... like that ...

218
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Kindly ...

219
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
- Hello?

220
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:56,000
You know it's almost midnight?

221
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Ah, it's you Richie, what happens?

222
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:04,000
He accepted???

223
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Do not worry, I'll call Paul. We will spend the night if necessary but he will have his car.

224
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:12,000
You do not worry, just say the champion to rest. We won't give hime up.

225
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Good night.

226
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:21,000
- What's the matter? you explain?
- Do you feel like doing a race?

227
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:25,000
BJ need us. He'll meet Tony Benito tomorrow at 4pm and that he wants him prepares his car.

228
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:29,000
- Go darling dressed.
- Right now.

229
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:45,000
(Answering crap ...)

230
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Hello?

231
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Rocket? come on stand up! We must prepare a car for BJ.

232
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:53,000
We shall be with you whithin an hour.

233
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:57,000
If you're up good for you or we wake you up. See you soon.

234
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:04,000
A coffee before leaving ...

235
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:10,000
- What is he doing?
- Do not worry, he will not miss the appointment.

236
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
So?

237
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:21,000
The car is ready. Still no news of BJ.

238
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:29,000
Oh great ... this dear Benito ...

239
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:33,000
Oh ... already he could not be late ...?

240
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Do not especially impress by its small number of tap dancing.
Just act like he doesn't exist, it's not complicated.

241
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:54,000
But where is he hiding? I told 4pm, where he's hiding?

242
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:58,000
He made in his pants I bet, huh? He can't read the time, where is he?

243
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:04,000
Huh? Where is this fieet BJ?

244
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,000
And don't look me like that

245
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:11,000
You just brush head, he will come.

246
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:16,000
I give it 5 more minutes to deflate. You can tell him that if he is not on the hill is that it's over!

247
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:20,000
- He is chatty ...

248
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:24,000
I should have stroke him ...

249
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,000
He really is a caricature.

250
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:31,000
BJ will be addressed. You shouldn't be nervous. Forget this clown. He just wants to impress us.

251
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Still, I wonder what happened to BJ ...

252
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:41,000
If you ask me, it came out take the car without speaking

253
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:44,000
and he quietly waits at the place of rendezvous.

254
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:48,000
to not be discouraged

255
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:52,000
Yeah, you're right, he'll shove a hammering.

256
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Hey Turkle. You are not as cheesy as I thought,

257
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:44,000
you drive fast ... take that, I'll give you my car I would not need where I go.

258
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:48,000
I always knew that fools category you were a true champion!

259
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Tony Benito, I have a warrant against you. That's right, I forgot to tell you:

260
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:08,000
I belong to the drug squad.

261
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Go, come aboard

262
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Tony Benito was sentenced to 20 years for drug trafficking.

263
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:22,000
Turkle took part in the 500 miles of Daytona he won five years to the day after the death of Bobby Hicks.
