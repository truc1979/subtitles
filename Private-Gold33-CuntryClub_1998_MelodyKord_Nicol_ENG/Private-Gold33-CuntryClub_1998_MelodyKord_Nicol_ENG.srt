=======================

2
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:20,000
Come on April, don't make me beg

3
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Saturday is going to be a big party in the city

4
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I would like you to come

5
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I don't waste my time with the boys. Your place is in the playground.

6
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Why do you think she's so stuck up?

7
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Maybe she likes girls.

8
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,460
Forget her guys. I have a good news.

9
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:42,000
In this afternoon there will be a new chick

10
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Tell us about her Robert?

11
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
That's all I have on her. Miss Baker told me when I went to see her this morning

12
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,200
Yeah we have to break in the new chick

13
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,710
- Oh yeah!
- Okay

14
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,710
Not bad, uh?

15
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,000
Okay guys. Training stops. It's going good

16
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,249
Hmm you know the teacher may have been right,

17
00:02:55,259 --> 00:03:00,000
But I think we got something we could shoot a whole lot better with

18
00:03:00,049 --> 00:03:03,000
What are you thinking about?

19
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,009
- I know what he thinks about!
- Oh yeah...

20
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:10,400
I almost forgot, Rachel: I promised at the Dean

21
00:03:10,409 --> 00:03:14,020
if you usher this new girl around the school

22
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,009
We can't go swinging with the boys

23
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,869
Did you know, the club is like that, they need a lot of money.

24
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,869
let's go

25
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I don't mind

26
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:06,500
Everybody take advantage of me. I'm sick of this.

27
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:11,140
Everyday the guys go for April, and here comes this new girl Vicky.

28
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:14,170
Probably a spoiled brat.

29
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,020
- Hi, I'm Rachel, you must be Vicky?
- Yes, hi Rachel

30
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,010
I hope we can be friends

31
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,970
You never know how can happen let me

32
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:26,970
- Let me help you
- Ok thanks

33
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,970
There! She's fine!

34
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,970
Baby! Baby I need you!

35
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,560
All guys are idiots...

36
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:45,000
What happens with that girl? They can't make working their mind?

37
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,420
Okay everyone. You know that soon there will be a test

38
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,640
and that is why you should workout

39
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:57,310
and anyone with a special workout they should start in the weight room

40
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:05,239
Well I have an idea: why don't we all go on our workout?

41
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:36,430
The others probably went swimming

42
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,330
I'm interested in everything about her

43
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:56,420
Angela, she was the main force of the guys

44
00:15:56,449 --> 00:16:03,019
but now the guys are paying more attention to Vicky

45
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,819
No, not like that

46
00:28:57,470 --> 00:29:01,510
I'm so excited Steve. Last time I was also excited,

47
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,000
when I was a kid I went with my brother to climb the mountain

48
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,410
but this is different.
- Sorry Vicky, it's only me

49
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:12,010
- Don't be so stuck off Steve, let's keep going
- Okay

50
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:51,200
What's wrong April?

51
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,960
None of your business. You want to know,

52
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:58,000
since this little Vicky is here every guy is beating on her

53
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,500
Yes well with her at least I could probably get a good fuck

54
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:06,120
but with you we've been trying to get you in bed for two years

55
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:08,500
and no one's got lucky yet. Or am I wrong?

56
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:12,900
No you're wrong because I'm waiting for the right one that will marry me

57
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,940
You'll die a virgin.

58
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:19,160
no one's want to marry you or engage with you

59
00:30:19,169 --> 00:30:22,000
until they get you in bed know how you are

60
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,000
She's so dumb.

61
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,500
So fine.

62
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,349
This Vicky is very interesting

63
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:31,000
Watch ou Steve!

64
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Where did he go? Did he fall?

65
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
This is your fault!

66
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Instead of paying attention to climbing

67
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,990
he's looking at your ass.

68
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,490
Let's not talk about this

69
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:09,000
Show me what happened

70
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:14,000
You are lucky it's not that bad

71
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:23,300
Did you check here? It hurts a little bit

72
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Here?

73
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,660
A little bit more

74
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,160
- Maybe here?
- Yes, better

75
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:34,560
- Then... it may be... here.
- Yes

76
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:38,350
We got the permission to take Vicky at Rally Racing

77
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:41,790
The question is: which one of us?

78
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:44,870
Oh perhaps we should draw matches

79
00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:46,920
that will be the fair way to do it

80
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,500
You are right

81
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:51,270
Okay guys have you got any matches?

82
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:53,270
Let's see

83
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,850
Let's see. I will take the head of some

84
00:44:57,970 --> 00:45:00,070
I will stay the same, we'll go in line I will be

85
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:04,370
We'll go in line. I will be the last.

86
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:08,160
Whoever will get the match without head

87
00:45:08,170 --> 00:45:10,660
get to take Vicky

88
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,570
Lucky bastard

89
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:31,070
Don't worry guys you will get later on

90
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,510
That what is very fine

91
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:35,510
okay

92
00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:38,250
Hey, check the tire pressure also

93
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,050
Let's go baby

94
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:08,530
For Vicky, she sure knows a lot about cars

95
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:12,030
I hope her car will throw her

96
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:14,670
You are a fucking asshole April

97
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:23,909
Come on guys, we'll be late for volleyball match

98
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:16,080
you didn't tell me you can drive like that

99
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:19,100
I was a junior champion a couple of years ago

100
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:19,870
Ah, that's why it's so easy

101
00:48:19,870 --> 00:48:21,660
that's why it's so easy

102
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:23,360
Can I give you a big hug?

103
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:26,360
- You don't want to hug me!
- What do you mean?

104
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:29,420
You know I've never did it on a race car before

105
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:32,420
It would be very weird to do it here

106
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:34,240
but I've nothing against it

107
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:38,750
(very funny...)
(yeah as you know him)

108
00:59:39,050 --> 00:59:41,000
Hello girls

109
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:43,260
So which one of you girls wants to come

110
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:45,510
jet skiing? Maybe you Rachel?

111
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:47,470
I don't feel like it

112
00:59:47,470 --> 00:59:49,470
Only three jets. I will stay here.

113
00:59:49,470 --> 00:59:53,440
- Okay but no horse plan!
- Stupid!

114
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:26,000
What's up? Something wrong?

115
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
What did you say?

116
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,500
I've asked what is the problem?

117
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:32,240
With me? Nothing.

118
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:34,559
It's like you are in a different world

119
01:01:35,259 --> 01:01:38,850
Oh. I doesn't think April likes Vicky.

120
01:01:38,850 --> 01:01:40,350
They're almost the same because for

121
01:01:40,350 --> 01:01:42,960
two years, didn't get none

122
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,200
That's enough of this!

123
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:47,340
Everyone is talking about little virgin April

124
01:01:47,340 --> 01:01:50,000
and crazy sexy Vicky

125
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
What's her problem?

126
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
What's wrong with her?

127
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,500
I don't know. Maybe she's just...

128
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Ah. The reason we came back here,

129
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,009
we ran into Maggie on the way back and

130
01:02:00,009 --> 01:02:04,230
we thought we put together some hot sex action together

131
01:02:04,230 --> 01:02:06,630
- It's a good idea
- yeah

132
01:02:06,630 --> 01:02:10,010
- I think we're going to have some fun
- Yes

133
01:12:52,870 --> 01:12:54,870
Look at this, men

134
01:12:59,870 --> 01:13:03,970
- Ah, there are jetski
- Yeah, that's gonna be fun

135
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:42,940
Come on Pete, let's do a race

136
01:13:42,940 --> 01:13:45,060
- Okay let's go
- Me too

137
01:13:45,740 --> 01:13:48,849
Take one of the jet skis

138
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:05,249
Take one

139
01:14:06,980 --> 01:14:09,000
You should pick this Mylar, Vicky

140
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:13,200
Don't (...) then we go this way. Take this Mylar

141
01:14:40,590 --> 01:14:43,350
I would like to talk to you Steve

142
01:14:43,350 --> 01:14:46,420
Now? About something concerning school?

143
01:14:46,420 --> 01:14:47,869
No, what I want to talk about is different

144
01:14:47,869 --> 01:14:48,869
I'm listening

145
01:14:48,869 --> 01:14:51,500
- Not here, in the house
- Okay

146
01:15:15,659 --> 01:15:18,009
Now you can tell me

147
01:15:18,009 --> 01:15:19,210
This is so embarrassing, Steve

148
01:15:19,210 --> 01:15:22,279
I know that you have been trying to get with me

149
01:15:22,279 --> 01:15:26,710
and I've been shutting you out and everyone else

150
01:15:26,710 --> 01:15:29,299
The only reason I did this is because

151
01:15:29,299 --> 01:15:32,199
I never did it with anyone and I was scared

152
01:15:32,199 --> 01:15:34,399
You're a virgin?

153
01:15:34,399 --> 01:15:36,730
this is not important but I feel alone

154
01:15:36,730 --> 01:15:39,129
Since Vicky has been here at the academy

155
01:15:39,129 --> 01:15:43,529
everyone has been paying attention to her and I can't handle it

156
01:15:43,529 --> 01:15:46,169
so I want you to fuck me

157
01:15:46,169 --> 01:15:47,350
Are you kidding?

158
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,500
Does this convince you?

159
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:56,000
Wow, I can tell you're not joking

160
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:58,400
Come on, do something

161
01:15:58,400 --> 01:15:59,500
If you want to

162
01:23:17,210 --> 01:23:18,309
What happened?

163
01:23:19,050 --> 01:23:20,420
Something hurts?

164
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:22,400
Yes, my... my ankle

165
01:23:22,910 --> 01:23:25,480
You should go to see a doctor, it could be broken

166
01:23:26,010 --> 01:23:27,380
What happened?

167
01:23:27,380 --> 01:23:30,000
Vicky rolled over, someone sabotage her jet

168
01:23:30,020 --> 01:23:32,940
That's probably April, because she hates Vicky

169
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,000
What do you have to say?

170
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:57,200
You're joking? You think I could do something like this?

171
01:24:04,599 --> 01:24:07,500
You probably did this to be back in the spotlight

172
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:10,000
I would never do anything like this

173
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Maybe she's telling the truth

174
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,009
Of course I'm telling the truth

175
01:24:13,300 --> 01:24:15,000
well I have a different feeling

176
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:18,270
Maybe we'll go back out and you can try the other jet skis

177
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:19,200
Why not

178
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,700
- And Sue?
- Of course

179
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:24,100
- Rachel?
- Why not

180
01:24:25,670 --> 01:24:28,010
Good. Then we can go into race

181
01:24:28,010 --> 01:24:30,940
We'll go down there to that point and

182
01:24:31,010 --> 01:24:32,500
turn around and come back

183
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:35,150
since you have the smaller boat, Rachel

184
01:24:35,150 --> 01:24:37,450
you can have a 10-second head start

185
01:24:37,450 --> 01:24:39,100
Here is the key

186
01:24:41,720 --> 01:24:43,419
What's the matter Rachel? You're scared?

187
01:24:43,429 --> 01:24:45,419
Maybe April did it

188
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,419
I wouldn't start it

189
01:24:47,419 --> 01:24:49,860
you're the one who sabotaged it

190
01:24:50,100 --> 01:24:51,200
Not true

191
01:24:53,219 --> 01:24:54,860
If I remember at the start

192
01:24:54,860 --> 01:24:57,580
you told Vicky to take the small boat

193
01:24:57,580 --> 01:24:59,669
or do I remember wrong?

194
01:25:01,100 --> 01:25:05,000
What do you say? For once, think.

195
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,500
You all are fucking assholes and I

196
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:09,500
hate this story and school anyway

197
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,800
How did you know, Eric?

198
01:25:15,179 --> 01:25:17,149
I'll tell you at school

199
01:25:17,149 --> 01:25:19,160
once Vicky gets back from the doctor

200
01:25:19,160 --> 01:25:21,000
we'll have a big party

201
01:25:31,980 --> 01:25:33,960
May I have your attention ladies and gentlemen

202
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:36,590
this afternoon we will cleared up that

203
01:25:36,590 --> 01:25:40,200
accident what happened today and from

204
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:43,710
today Rachel Stern is suspended because

205
01:25:43,710 --> 01:25:46,500
she took responsibility for what's

206
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:50,220
happened. And teachers got together and

207
01:25:50,220 --> 01:25:54,809
everybody came up with the idea that we

208
01:25:54,809 --> 01:25:57,000
go and shoot party

209
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:58,000
(Yeah)

210
01:25:59,809 --> 01:26:00,900
And I suggest you use

211
01:26:00,900 --> 01:26:03,720
your opportunity while the teaching

212
01:26:03,720 --> 01:26:08,610
staff go in a city so starting Monday is

213
01:26:08,610 --> 01:26:10,610
back to work

214
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,000
Now you can tell us how you knew Rachel did it

215
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:16,830
Well I didn't

216
01:26:16,830 --> 01:26:19,100
it was just a gut feeling

217
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:22,600
When Steve and the girls left to go mountain climbing

218
01:26:22,610 --> 01:26:25,430
I saw Rachel do something to Vicky's rope

219
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:27,500
and when I questioned her about it

220
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:29,500
she became defensive

221
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,400
if her little plan had worked,

222
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:34,500
April would have been expulsed from school

223
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:36,410
and Vicki may have been killed

224
01:26:36,410 --> 01:26:38,100
Nice job Eric

225
01:26:38,100 --> 01:26:39,900
Does your leg still hurt?

226
01:26:39,900 --> 01:26:41,000
Not anymore

227
01:26:41,100 --> 01:26:45,309
The main thing is that we cleared it up with April

228
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,500
I was going to say the same about Vicky because

229
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:50,000
because she made me understand

230
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:53,600
why sex is such an important thing

231
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:55,000
I am happy.

232
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:56,600
What but do you think people? Let's have a big party

233
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:59,600
Let's have a big party!
