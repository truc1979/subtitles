2
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
In the heat of Saint-Tropez

3
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
That's fine

4
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Good. Remarkable

5
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Keep on going

6
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000


7
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Be careful Zaza, I'm filming you

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000


9
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Well, great

10
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000


11
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Look at me

12
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Now on the action

13
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000


14
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
- Eddy, be careful, follow me
- Ok boss

15
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Magnificent

16
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
- More cable, Eddy
- Ok boss

17
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Go ahead, suck, suck

18
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Suck. You will make him cum

19
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Great!

20
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000


21
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Wonderful!

22
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000


23
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Slowly. It is very good

24
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Come on Zaza. Like home

25
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Good. With your tongue, yes

26
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Do you like it?

27
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Good. It's beautiful love and ... CUT!

28
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Ok boss

29
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You are all sensational
Right, Coco?

30
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Ah! Peter!

31
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000


32
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
- Say, for the check of the boss, I'm waiting for a return of money ...

33
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
- That's not what was planned. Let's make a deal ...

34
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
... you find me a girl, and we forget everything. A virgin

35
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
- Okay. As soon as we arrive in Paris I take care of that
- I trust you

36
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
- Bye Rudy! See you soon!
- Give me your bag, darling

37
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
- Ciao. See you next weekend

38
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Oh my Zaza!

39
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Don't move. I'm going to take a picture

40
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Come on, say "cheese"!

41
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Reproduced by justice and rejected by society ...

42
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
... because he raped a 15-year-old girl ...

43
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
... then forgive him again. Thank you

44
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
- Dad. I need to talk to you
- I'm listening

45
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I am invited to Brittany for the weekend ...

46
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
... at a very nice friend's house
- you have to talk to your mother. She worries easily

47
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
- It's a 17th century mansion. With large fireplaces
- I like old stones ...

48
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
... I wish I had a manor ...

49
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
... but is my daughter reasonable? These houses are wet

50
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Listen daddy, that's not the question. Do you agree or not?

51
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It will be necessary to speak with your mother. I must think

52
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
- And then I would like to see your friend
- Well, she is here. Brigitte?

53
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Brigitte, I present you my dad

54
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Nice to meet you. Hello miss

55
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
- Hello sir
- It's Brigitte

56
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Very honored to meet you
Your father has a mansion?

57
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
- What's going on Gaston?

58
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Miss Brigitte invites our daughter ...

59
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
... in the manor house of his parents in Brittany
- Oh, a mansion!

60
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
- And the 17th century!

61
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Well, my daughter, for me it's okay

62
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And I agree too

63
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
But it will be necessary that Carine regularly gives us news

64
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I trust you

65
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Madam, do not worry. And then you know ...

66
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
... Brittany is a very quiet place at this time. Everything will be fine

67
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I trust you

68
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
- When are you leaving?
- Well, right now!

69
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
- Oh, these young people ...!

70
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
- Thanks thanks
- Call us!
- Of course Mom. Do not worry

71
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Be wise
Good bye, young lady

72
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Please Gaston, take off those clothes!

73
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Really? My sweet dove...

74
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Oh no, no

75
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Times have changed...

76
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Taxi!

77
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Go, I'll tell you later
You'll see we're going to laugh!

78
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Me this is my first weekend

79
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'm dressing up

80
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Please Madam, take us to Orly airport

81
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Do you know Mont Saint-Michel?

82
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Hey, Carine? Do you know Mont Saint-Michel?

83
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Where did you get that?

84
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Do not worry, I organize everything. It's for your parents

85
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I have a friend in Brittany who will send this card from there

86
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Awesome!

87
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You just have to write a message on it

88
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You got some balls! You should have warned me. Besides, I did not bring any clothes

89
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Zaza, you've done some crazy things again!

90
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I just bought some things

91
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
- You are looking good!
- Zaza is still in shape!

92
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Well Zaza, it's great

93
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Turn to me

94
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000


95
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Very good

96
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000


97
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Turn around a little bit. Like that

98
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It's beautiful, it's wonderful

99
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
All this, it moves

100
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
- Hop!
- Nice

101
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It is very good

102
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000


103
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You have been wonderful

104
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
A little complaint ... I'll explain

105
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Look at the people on the harbor, and I'll get you fucked by Eddy

106
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
- No, I say no
- Come on ...

107
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Eddy? Eddy? I need you

108
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
- There is work for you
- Yes Boss?

109
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I hope you are in shape. Here

110
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Thanks boss

111
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Engine!

112
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
(phone ringing)

113
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Alain? You can answer?

114
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Leave me alone

115
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Everyone is lazy here

116
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Hello?

117
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
You did not forget our deal? The girl?

118
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Yes it is OK. Brigitte is with her

119
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
- Say, it's not an old model?
- No, it's a good deal ...

120
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
... it's Alban's girlfriend's look-alike

121
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Great. So you're going to have a party tonight

122
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
What kind?

123
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Like "California"

124
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
- OK Bye
- Right away

125
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
So? You're having fun? Tanning?

126
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Do not touch that. Who called?

127
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It's Rudy. He comes just now

128
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
You transform it into beauty. He must want her

129
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Trust me darling

130
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Carine, get ready, we'll go shopping

131
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
- I have no money
- Do not worry, Peter will organize everything

132
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Yes I will organize everything. Alain take the car, go with them

133
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I am not a stooge!

134
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Wow!

135
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
- Do you like it?
- Yes a lot. You look beautiful

136
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
- Brigitte? Brigitte?
- Yes I'm coming

137
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Show me?

138
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
See you later, I'll be back in 5 minutes

139
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I'll have to leave you. Alain, you're going to go with my friend
She is beautiful, right?

140
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
- Where are we going?
- How are we doing?

141
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
- It's not the way back
- No, but we can also go through this path

142
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
It's by Ramatuelle. You'll see it's very pretty

143
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
- Do you like him, Peter?
- Yes why?

144
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
- Because I feel I'm different

145
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Why do you feel different?

146
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I do not like doing stupid things

147
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Yippee! Watch out!

148
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
- Do you like my legs?
- Yes, they are beautiful

149
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
- Say Alain, you want us to make love together?

150
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
- You are direct!

151
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Great

152
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
You know, I already had sex once. With a friend

153
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
- How old were you?
- 15 years old

154
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
But then we did not do it anymore

155
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
- And are you afraid now?
- Come on, this is beautiful here

156
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Yes, when I'm bored I come here often. Look how beautiful

157
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Do you see the sun through the trees?

158
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
You do not have to be afraid

159
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I'm not afraid. I want to learn

160
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
So let yourself go, princess

161
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Take this off

162
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Kiss Me

163
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Say Caro, tan-time is over

164
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I'm not here to get bored. I'm invited by Rudy. OK?

165
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Yes ... I know, Rudy, I know

166
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Peter! Woh-oh!

167
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
In my arms, dear friend!

168
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
The crazy dancer is here

169
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
- It's okay?
- Really fine

170
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
So? Which one is it?

171
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Wait, come and sit down

172
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
- The girl? Where is she?
- Brigitte prepares her

173
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
- What are you offering me?
- Everything is here

174
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
- A whiskey

175
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
And the girl, did you tell me it was Alban's girlfriend's look-alike?

176
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
- Yes
- Are you sure?

177
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
So you also know that she has to make a video just for me

178
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
It should not shock her, because it's the first time

179
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Do not forget that it is a gambling debt

180
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Look at your Zaza. She is incredible

181
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
- Hello!
- Here she is!

182
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
- Hey! Boys!

183
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Look! Here she is!

184
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
- You like her?
- You know me, I have to touch

185
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
- Zaza!
- Brigitte!

186
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
- I'll introduce you to Rudy
- Nice to meet you

187
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
- Hello
- Do you want to drink something? Champagne?

188
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
You are very beautiful

189
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
More than beautiful. She is divine

190
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Peter is absolutely right

191
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
But you do not know Zaza, she is in front of you

192
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
It's my muse. My star

193
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I did not tell you what my job was. I work in advertising

194
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
- Carine, are you listening?
- Yes, advertising

195
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
- You are beautiful
- What do you want?
- A kiss from the princess

196
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
- What? It annoys you?
- No ... but I'm prude ...

197
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Bite the breast. Bite

198
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
- It's the air of Saint-Tropez ...
- I would not like to do that

199
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
- Come on, kiss me ...
- In Saint-Tropez

200
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Oh! I must call my father!

201
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
- But, you'll call him later
- Give me the phone

202
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
- Can not you call him later?

203
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
- No, I'm going to call my dad now. Where is the phone?

204
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
In the living room. That would be more quiet

205
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
See you soon

206
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Oh, not bad!

207
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
- Hello? Dad?
- Ah, you're my daughter! (Mom!)

208
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
It is a pleasure. You're having fun? The weather is nice?

209
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Yes we have fun, we eat well. And you Daddy, how are you? What are you doing?

210
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Yes, we watch TV, there is a good movie

211
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
But, it is not too wet?

212
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Ah, you can say that ... And mom?

213
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Listen, (...)

214
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Oh, stop. Hush!
Yes Dad

215
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
No no, I'm fine

216
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
- (Hello?)
- (Leave me alone, it's my dad on the phone)

217
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Yes, hello Dad? Yes Dad, I hear you. Say hello to Mom

218
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,000
- It's sunny in Paris?
- Oh ... as usual

219
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Oh? Here it is (ouch) a splendid time (ouch)

220
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
- Hello?
- Hello Papa?

221
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Goodbye Dad, bye Mom

222
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
We too. Call back tomorrow. Bye darling

223
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
- You are assholes
- We're doing this to laugh

224
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
It does not make me laugh at all

225
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Listen ... Calm down. It was really to laugh ...

226
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
That's OK. I do not want you anymore

227
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Well, then kiss me

228
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
... I'm going to talk to him

229
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000


230
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
It's not possible for tonight. It's a shame, she's tired

231
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
See you tomorrow at the beach. Do not worry, I take care of her, there is no problem

232
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I promise you it'll be better tomorrow

233
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
My video stayed at your place

234
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Do not worry, she is in a safe place

235
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
No problem
Well, we'll go back

236
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Okay!

237
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
- Carine? Carine! We come back
- Carine!

238
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
- Hello !
- Hello Goodbye!

239
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
See you tomorrow!

240
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000


241
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
- Tell him goodbye
- Bye

242
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Here. Very good

243
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
It's good

244
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
And it continues

245
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
When Rudy goes to see that, he will not be happy

246
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Not at all happy

247
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Do not worry. I'm filming, I'm shooting

248
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Go ahead Brigitte

249
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Masturbates her

250
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
- I never did that myself!
- Everybody needs a first time!

251
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
- It's bad...
- Oh yes it's bad

252
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
You film at least?

253
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Yes!

254
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000


255
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Now, you're going to give Peter a blowjob

256
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
- I do not know how to do that ...
- I will help you

257
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
- Come here
- Yes, wait, I'm coming

258
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Come on come

259
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Come on, look

260
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Go eat everything

261
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Go Carine

262
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
- There, the glans. Take it
- Suck

263
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Look, I'll take it

264
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Look at Brigitte

265
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
- Are you ok Brigitte?
- I'm crazy!

266
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Come on, cheers on vacation!

267
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Oh hi !

268
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,000


269
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Come on, around the table!

270
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Show your buttocks

271
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000


272
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
(... So much extra this Carine ...)

273
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
(... Phone us!)
(- Of course mom)

274
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000


275
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Please!

276
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000


277
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Please!

278
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Yes I'm coming!

279
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,000


280
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Can you bring me your phone?

281
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
- Right now, beauty
- Thank you

282
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,000


283
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
- Hello?
- Allo daddy? It's me!

284
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
- Ah, you're my daughter!
- Yes it's me

285
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
- Hello dad, how are you?
- Good

286
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
- Have you received my postcard?
- Yes, she was very pretty,

287
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
watch out for sunburn, it's dangerous

288
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Yes Dad

289
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
(Come come). There is your mother

290
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
How are you mom? I have fun, I eat well, I sleep well

291
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Good! Wait, wait!

292
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Your mother and I decided to come see you

293
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,000
It's a good idea, huh? What do you think?

294
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Hello? Yes No...

295
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
You know Brigitte's parents are sick ...

296
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
What do you mean? Sick?

297
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,500
Dad, I have to leave now

298
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,000
Hello? Hello?

299
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
- Carine?
- Goodbye daddy!

300
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,000
I do not recognize my daughter ...

301
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Listen. Leave me

302
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Cheers!

303
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,000
No need to run!

304
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
You took my towel!

305
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Good, young people. Prepare yourselves

306
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
We have an appointment with Wilfried on his boat

307
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Hurry up, he does not like being late

308
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Naked!

309
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,000


310
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
So? See you tonight?

311
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Yes, no problem. And you come with the check, ok?

312
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I trust you. You organize that well

313
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,000
- See you tonight
- Bye

314
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Zaza!

315
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000


316
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Move a bit

317
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,000


318
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Hello motorcycles

319
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,000


320
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Let's see...

321
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,000


322
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Not bad

323
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,000


324
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Oh bastard. He fucked her

325
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
The bastard

326
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
He had me again

327
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,000


328
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,000
"GREAT GIN!"

329
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Bravo darling!

330
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000


331
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Wait, it's not over

332
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000


333
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
You want to drink something?

334
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
A gin tonic

335
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
For me Gin Fiz

336
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,000
- Of course
- I am coming with you. I will help you

337
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Bring me a beer without foam please, ok?

338
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
"GREAT GIN!"

339
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
- There you go!

340
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
You owe me a lot of money

341
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
I'll give you a check

342
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
What kind of this time?

343
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Listen Rudy,

344
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
I give you a check, you put it in the bank in 15 days

345
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
It's possible?

346
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Listen to me,

347
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
last night,

348
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,500
you took me for an idiot

349
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,400
Don't say that ...

350
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,000
So you catch up tonight and then ...

351
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
And?

352
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
We forget everything

353
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Okay. Do not worry, I organized everything

354
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
You'll see she agrees. There is no problem

355
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
No I do not want to

356
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Listen...

357
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Brigitte? Why does he ask me that?

358
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,000
If you go with them, Peter gets his 40,000 Francs

359
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Do you understand my darling? It's a game between them

360
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
You understand?

361
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
No

362
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000


363
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,000
I warn you. Your parents think you are in Brittany. You understand?

364
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
You know what I mean?

365
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,000
So Peter ... you're really disgusting

366
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
You are bastard

367
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,300
You don't think you hit too hard, Peter?

368
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:10,300
I had no choice. We'll see that later

369
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Come on, that's good Zaza!

370
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
You were absolutely perfect!

371
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Rudy? Come see

372
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,000


373
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Carine? Rudy wants to talk to you alone

374
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
I brought it to you

375
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000


376
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Good. We will leave you

377
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000


378
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Ciao

379
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,000


380
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Oh no...

381
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000


382
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Oh no, I never did that

383
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Oh no really I do not want

384
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
It makes me feel uncomfortable

385
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,000


386
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Okay darling?

387
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Look!

388
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,000


389
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
I'll take a little breathe outside

390
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:49,000


391
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Well? You're watching?

392
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
No no

393
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Yes you are!

394
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000


395
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
You want to make love?

396
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
No thanks. It's okay

397
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,000


398
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Come on, come on!

399
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
No, I do not feel like it

400
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Follow Zaza!

401
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
I tell you I do not want to

402
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,000


403
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
(I have a great desire to make love with you, follow Zaza)

404
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,000


405
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
But what are you doing?

406
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000


407
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,000
No, I do not want

408
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Hello!

409
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000


410
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:08,000
There is still coffee?

411
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Did you sleep well tonight?

412
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Very good. And you?

413
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Very good

414
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Say, you got off last night

415
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Very very good

416
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,000
But I saw you leaving last night with Zaza

417
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
That's not it ... but no, I ...

418
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Hi young people!

419
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
You had sweet dreams?

420
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
- Are you in shape Alain?

421
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
- Can be OK

422
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Hello

423
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Are you coming to play tennis with me?

424
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Yes, I will prepare myself. I arrive

425
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Coffee

426
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,000
You know you should start playing tennis. It feels good

427
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,000
And it's very good for reflexes

428
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
What's the matter? You do not want to talk to me?

429
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Yes that's it. You should stop shadowing me. You understand?

430
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Oh my brother, listen ... Is it because of Carine? You're in love?

431
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
You fucked her already?

432
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Oh that's it, you fucked her!

433
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
You did not get anything

434
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Are you coming, Peter? I am ready

435
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Ciao

436
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Let's go

437
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:52,000


438
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Be careful with the legs

439
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:59,000
I start, it's not my fault

440
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Peter!

441
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,000
- Peter, come see
- What now?

442
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
So?

443
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,000
What is happening?

444
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Come on, I'm tired of playing

445
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,000
It's fine because I'm really tired

446
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:08,000
We will continue another time. Come

447
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Say, do you know where there is a phone?

448
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Yes. Do you want to call your parents? To your dad?

449
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Come. Enter

450
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,500
But what are you doing?

451
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:23,000
Listening. You'll see it's nothing

452
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Go over there

453
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Peter, what are you doing?

454
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,000
No ... but no

455
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,000
- Let me do
- I do not want to make love here

456
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,000
- No I tell you, let me go
- Let it go

457
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:41,000
No, no and no

458
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Well, just a little bit then

459
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Why?

460
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Because

461
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
You exaggerate...

462
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
But no. Go ahead

463
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Everything in your little mouth

464
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Go Carine

465
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Come on, suck me quickly

466
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
No, I do not want to do stupid things anymore

467
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,000
But it's not stupid things

468
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Ouch! Are you stupid or what? Stop it

469
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Stop you hurt me

470
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
You are a good sucker

471
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Is your daddy teaching you?

472
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Bastard! You are a real bastard

473
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:55,000
I was joking!

474
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Oops, it's busy

475
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:04,000
You must not save yourself!

476
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Stop messing around!

477
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Now you know what a cock is

478
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:14,000
At least I would have seen a lot

479
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Oh no! Not that!

480
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Leave me. You exaggerate

481
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,000
come this way

482
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000


483
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Come, I tell you

484
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Drop your pants

485
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:07,000
No, not with the camera

486
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Not that

487
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Not in front of the pussy. It's better

488
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Eat it

489
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Take that away

490
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
It's better

491
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Close up on the pussy

492
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,000
That's enough?

493
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Great!

494
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Go away

495
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:44,000
With one finger only

496
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Yes, well on the clitoris

497
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Well, come and lick her pussy now

498
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:26,000
The light

499
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Eddy, you're in great shape today

500
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Go ahead Eddy! Put everything inside

501
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:46,000


502
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Good Eddy

503
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000


504
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Your turn Peter

505
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Eddy, that's great

506
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,000
You, hurry

507
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:44,000
I'll wait for you at Canubiers Bay

508
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Eddy, take your stuff away. We go to the port

509
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
The others are waiting for us at the boat

510
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,000
You're storing the video too

511
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Peter, you finish

512
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Yes, we join you

513
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:58,000
right away. Ciao

514
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Oh I'm cuming

515
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Shit! I must call my father!

516
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Do you know where there is a phone?

517
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Yes, you go to the bar, you tell them that I will pay

518
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Come on hurry up. We are in a hurry

519
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Sir! The phone please?

520
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:36,000
At the bar. Straight ahead

521
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Hello dad?

522
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Ah finally! You decide to call

523
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
When are you coming back?

524
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,000
I do not know...

525
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
How "you do not know" ?

526
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,000
What does it mean?

527
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Carine, you worry me

528
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Oh dad. I am no longer a little girl

529
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000


530
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Let me live my life

531
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Quick, Rudy is waiting for us at the boat

532
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:08,000
You do not look in your normal state

533
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Finally, maybe not "abnormal" state but...

534
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,500
I tell you daddy, we're going for a walk at sea

535
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:13,000
Beware, the forecast says it's going to be bad weather

536
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Do not worry. I kiss you, I love you. Kiss my mom!

537
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Bye Dad

538
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Rudy is waiting for us at the boat at Calubiers Bay

539
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,000
So beautiful angel?

540
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:33,000
I have the impression that the wind is rising

541
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
With waves it's great

542
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Everything is fine?

543
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:40,000
It starts to blow

544
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:53,000
It's beautiful, huh?

545
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Look, here they are

546
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:17,000
We arrive

547
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Hurry up! Get in!

548
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000


549
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Take my hand

550
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:00,000
Welcome everyone! Welcome aboard!

551
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:17,000
Start making couples, I'm coming

552
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Remember our deal, Peter?

553
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Very very well!

554
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:29,000
Good accounts make good friends

555
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
And little meetings make great fortunes

556
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,000
There I spoiled you!

557
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Yes, it was very good

558
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:38,000
You are an intelligent boy. You will go far

559
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Yes, it was remarkable

560
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Bravo Peter

561
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:46,000
That's it, we do not talk about anything

562
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
- It's okay?
- Perfect

563
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
I see that we take good care of you

564
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Ah, Caro, she's a queen

565
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Come on, make me bend

566
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000


567
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Stop laughing

568
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Eddy? And me then!

569
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,000
I'll lend you one

570
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000


571
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Come on Caro, jerk me off

572
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,000
And me?

573
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Just now

574
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Oh good

575
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Is that right, Rudy?

576
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Say, you're having a funny face? What is happening?

577
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Caro, if you're nice to my boyfriend, you'll be able to make a video

578
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:38,000
And in colors!

579
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:42,000
It's really good girls. You work well

580
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:48,000
It's good for Eddy

581
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Did you see Rudy? He is with 2 bitches

582
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
All sluts

583
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:58,000


584
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:23,000
It's hot! It's scorching

585
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
I'm fed up with all this mess

586
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:36,000
I think I need to change my air

587
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
You know what I mean?

588
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,000


589
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Take me!

590
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Come on!

591
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
I get off ...

592
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,000


593
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
What, what is it?

594
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Shit!

595
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
What are you doing?

596
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Come back!

597
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:28,000


598
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:34,000
What assholes!

599
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,000
- Darling!
- Yes?

600
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:54,000
- Do you wanna go shopping with me?
- No no

601
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Goodbye dear

602
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Ah! That's enough!

603
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Goodbye. I come back right away

604
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:37,000
I forgot the ice cubes

605
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Well!

606
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:55,000


607
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Hello dad

608
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
So, are you enjoying when mom is gone?

609
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:04,000
You watch hot movies

610
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Congratulations ... Bravo daddy

611
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Listen Carine ...

612
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,000
... well...

613
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
... Yes...

614
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:18,000
But do not tell mom

615
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:22,000
Of course I won't, dad. It's our secret

616
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Hey, I tell you it will remain our secret
