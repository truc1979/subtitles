San Francisco
Thursday afternoon 5:00

3
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Since I did pull in.

4
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Show me your breasts.

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Caress your tits. Shows.

6
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Yes, your nipples caress.

7
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Turn in order.

8
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Honey, what are you horny.

9
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Find je't good?

10
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Would Dolly Parton sleep on her back? What do you think?

11
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I think.

12
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Come here's suck my dick.

13
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Want to be fucked over?
- Yes Nice.

14
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Come sit on my face.

15
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,500
Like it hot?

16
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:48,500
Dolly Parton sleep on her back? What do you think?

17
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I think.

18
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Los Angeles
Friday Morning 9:00

19
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I just came home.
- I expect you tonight.

20
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I wanted to surprise you. Catch you with one other girl.

21
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Forget t but.

22
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
She's not in the living room.
Perhaps in the bedroom.

23
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Let's look for 't home.

24
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Who is that?
- I do not know.

25
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I do the financial column.
This is Kelly's department.

26
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Since she is not in the living room, they might ...

27
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
...in the bedroom.
Shall I look at?

28
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
If you're not careful, I'll throw you on the bed.

29
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Wake up, slut.

30
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Yes, wake up, intruder!
My baby is home ...

31
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
... and they'll kill you.
- I'll do you some.

32
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Do it then. Make my day.

33
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Wait. You can not see her. She is gone.

34
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
The next time I catch her.

35
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Meanwhile, you'll be doing it with me.

36
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
The girl was in the bedroom had just such a dress.

37
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
But its easier going out.

38
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Help me pull him over my head.

39
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
But you fucking better.

40
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
How do you know that?

41
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I tried her. Now I try you out.

42
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
She can find no better not show anymore.

43
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
You pull my panties?

44
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
What we did ...

45
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
You're the lucky not forgotten.

46
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Matter of aefenen.

47
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
But then keep practicing.

48
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Do you know whether you think the time did not do.

49
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,000
I can buy a new company car. He is already ...

50
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,000
... For the fourth time in two months each.

51
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Do you want to do something for me?

52
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I believe I know that woman.
You inquire after her?

53
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Those with the Crown Jewels?
- Yes

54
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I 'il ask Kelly.
- No, you would not do yourself?

55
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Yes, but why?

56
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I do not bother the newspaper.

57
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
How was your trip, anyway?
- Fine

58
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Did the car it good?
- Fine

59
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
One fine day.

60
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Hello, have you been on?
It's 10 o'clock.

61
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Would you stand by to stay for a party tonight?

62
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
The matter is rolling.

63
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,000
But now she's blonde.

64
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Gee, here I have not been long. Where is Sonny?

65
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
That is some story involved.

66
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Here, check this out.

67
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
These Laura Henderson Croft and her husband Gerald.

68
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
They have owned half the known universe.

69
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I like him.
- There he is.

70
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
What is it?

71
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
We'll get him. But I have to 'talk show m gain.

72
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Leave it to me. Waiter!

73
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Gisella I am and this is my cousin Muriel.

74
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
We were wondering if you were a pro golfer ...

75
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,000
... and you have seen playing Glen Campbell.

76
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
I sponsor some tournaments and lettuce at a ball.

77
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
No more.
- May we then ...

78
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
...ask a couple of questions?
Is it true that ...

79
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
... the longer the stick, the heavier the head?

80
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I do not know, but I do know a couple of golfers ...

81
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
... let their balls cushion with beautiful girls. Brings happiness.

82
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Do you have a woman that does that for you?

83
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Yes, but it is in Mexico.

84
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Then you have not had much luck lately.

85
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
That may change.

86
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I have an appointment at the hairdresser.

87
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
You try your luck but it's out.

88
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
I've never seen here.

89
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Yasuhiko, how is it?
- Best. And you?

90
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Fine. You look crazy out.

91
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,000
One looking woman. A girlfriend?
- Yes. Are you jealous now?

92
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Jealous of the stones.

93
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Want to see my golf clubs?

94
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Like.

95
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,000
I'll lick your cunt?

96
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Make him wet.

97
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Stick your finger in my cunt.

98
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Stick your cock in it.

99
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I think if you do Yasuhiko.

100
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
She looked nice.

101
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Her husband and I are partners. We export jewelry ...

102
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,000
... in the Far East.
- She seems to me a horny bitch.

103
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
You mean you feel like Sushi?

104
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,000
A nice piece of meat Californian has not gone well.

105
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Yasuhiko brings you into the seventh heaven.

106
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Bel 'r than when they bring you in heaven.

107
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Who the hell are you?
- And who are you?

108
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,000
A woman in her own home, which a gun on 'targeting a thief.

109
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
I a thief? I work for Mr. Henderson Croft.

110
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,000
I had to get this paper.
Are you Mrs. Henderson Croft?

111
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Coincidentally it.

112
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Had at least as a call before you came. Or beat.

113
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Your husband said you were in Mexico.
- Yes, I was in Mexico ...

114
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
... while he went golfing with the guys.

115
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,000
We go to the police, because I think ...

116
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,000
... you recognize my husband disagreed.
As he fell on top of you.

117
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Wait, do not. That bastard lied to me.

118
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,000
You know what...
Elizabeth, it's not?

119
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Yes that's right. Who are you?
- My name is Nikki.

120
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I just wanted to rob. We got your man at the club against.

121
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,000
My girlfriend keeps him busy.

122
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
I did not think he'd be lying.

123
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Lying is one profession from him.
So he sews ...

124
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,000
... some slut, and you will break.

125
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Has he fucked you?

126
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
And another thing: you'll do it well with women?

127
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,000
With everyone pointing a gun at me.

128
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Come with me.

129
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
What is it, Gerry?

130
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Yasuhiko, pulling in an afternoon-candy?

131
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,000
I've been called all day.

132
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Then you're right here.

133
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Gisella you already know?

134
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,000
You will 's best to find together.

135
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,000
If you 't nou' s try together, then I watch.

136
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,000
And when you almost come, then I'll be there.

137
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Fine with me.
- Fine with me.

138
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Fine with me.

139
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Say, I'm ready for the second round.

140
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Yes, we do.
- I have to leave.

141
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Oh yeah?

142
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:37,000
That's too bad.

143
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Where's the bathroom?
- Around the corner.

144
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Now I have you all to myself.

145
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:54,000
There 's seems to, huh?

146
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Hello, Tina
- Not now, Dwayne, I gotta go.

147
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,000
You know the rules. I'll do you right here handcuffs.

148
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Fucking?
- What did you think?

149
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,000
After you, darling.

150
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Well, McClaw, tell her her rights?

151
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:05,000
It is my duty to tell you that you're under arrest.

152
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:09,000
You 'right to remain silent. Anything can be used against you.

153
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Well, well, stop that nonsense. You have the jewels.

154
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:17,000
What more do you want?
- Something I do not know.

155
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Do you know Henderson Croft?
- Yes, the brother of his wife ...

156
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:25,000
... is police commissioner.
- We got him caught.

157
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Why? True? What? How?
- While I was with him was ...

158
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:33,000
... my girlfriend robbed his house empty.

159
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:37,000
McClaw, we go straight through.
Do you have the keys?

160
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:41,000
I thought you had.
- They are confident in the car.

161
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Want to store your gun?
Rambo's bunch.

162
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:06,000
I hear noises in the back.

163
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
A bit messy, is not it?

164
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:18,000
You are arrested
- You're talking right ...

165
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Not now.

166
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:24,000
For burglary, for starters.
- And what was it then?

167
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Here.

168
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,000
You are the burglar here.
- We got a tip ...

169
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:34,000
... which was broken here.

170
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Not so. We just needed a few gosers to fuck with.

171
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:42,000
That you, I think.
- You can not get ...

172
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:46,000
... how you want it.

173
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Tell them now but their rights.

174
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:35,000
What a job ...

175
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Is that gun off?

176
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Put your gun down.
Do not tear off, take off!

177
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:47,000
My gun diminish?
- Rambo gun.

178
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:57,000
Never throw a gun on the ground.

179
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Later I got a bullet in my ass.

180
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Take that hat off.
You're not Donald Duck.

181
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Hey, buddy, you got oil on you?

182
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Maybe in my holster.

183
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:23,000
No, no need, never mind.

184
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Eat it 's beer.
Then we grab 'n beer.

185
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Like 't good, McClaw?

186
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:22,000
If you stay with me, you get plenty of it.

187
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:57,000
Suck on that cock of McClaw.

188
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Hey, "agent McClaw" for you.

189
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:53,000
I will now read their rights?
You may remain silent.

190
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Anything you say can be used against you.

191
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:06,000
If I were you, I would look for your girlfriend Tina.

192
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Ready, McClaw?

193
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Good day, ladies. McClaw, we need to think about the time.

194
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Have you got the car keys?

195
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:29,000
You know, Nikki, your legs have saved your skin.

196
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Take care of them well.
- I will do.
