3
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,552
Congratulations on becoming agent Rachel.

4
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:26,785
I knew you had it in you.

5
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,861
Unfortunate about your husband though.

6
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:31,693
Yes.

7
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:35,890
Well, I could not let my feelings
for George compromise the mission.

8
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:57,900
Oh... Sorry.

9
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,301
Sorry!

10
00:04:13,401 --> 00:04:14,641
Sorry...

11
00:05:10,641 --> 00:05:11,700
Nice tits.

12
00:05:13,993 --> 00:05:16,094
Does your husband appreciate these?

13
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:20,811
No... Husband doesn't appreciate anything.

14
00:05:22,969 --> 00:05:23,890
Bull!

15
00:05:24,977 --> 00:05:26,336
Dead fool.

16
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,444
Ah, George never does that.

17
00:05:31,661 --> 00:05:33,878
George couldn't even make coffee.

18
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:17,227
Oh God Agent X, That's what a real fucking
secret-agent dick feels like.

19
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,740
Yeah.

20
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,750
- You can't teach that on training.
- No.

21
00:08:25,968 --> 00:08:27,269
I don't need that anymore.

22
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:15,686
George never makes me come.

23
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:18,778
George is a fool.

24
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:00,475
No evidence.

25
00:13:01,443 --> 00:13:02,377
Mission complete.

26
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,627
- Ah!
(- Ah)

27
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,420
- Ah!
- Ah!

28
00:13:09,419 --> 00:13:10,968
Jesus Christ.

29
00:13:11,368 --> 00:13:12,986
George you scared the crap out of me.

30
00:13:13,776 --> 00:13:16,969
Yeah? You should see it
from my point of view.

31
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,585
Dreamed about
that damn fish tank again?

32
00:13:25,986 --> 00:13:28,910
Yeah. Something like that.

33
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,286
Thank you.

34
00:16:14,204 --> 00:16:16,160
Oh I have my cereal.

35
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:17,945
Oh you think so?

36
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:21,109
Yeah. I do.

37
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,150
You feeling lucky?

38
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,169
Would you try to come take it?

39
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,184
Oh, I will.

40
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:44,176
You call yourself a secret agent,

41
00:16:44,953 --> 00:16:46,677
no wonder
they won't give you a promotion.

42
00:16:51,194 --> 00:16:52,111
Argh.

43
00:16:59,402 --> 00:17:00,703
Holly bitch.

44
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,351
Hey honey, I was thinking
we could ride in together.

45
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,059
I take it as a "no".

46
00:17:42,293 --> 00:17:43,243
Ladies first.

47
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,460
Age before beauty.

48
00:17:50,281 --> 00:17:51,953
Brains before stupidity.

49
00:18:00,776 --> 00:18:03,362
What I meant was you're the stupid one, ok?
(- Idiot)

50
00:18:03,393 --> 00:18:05,470
(I'm the smart one.
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT)

51
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:06,844
I meet you up--

52
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,785
Everybody knows that.

53
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,440
No.

54
00:18:30,827 --> 00:18:31,609
Oh...

55
00:18:34,229 --> 00:18:35,539
Oh no.

56
00:18:40,102 --> 00:18:41,651
Oh yeah, you want some of this.

57
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,700
[composing phone number]

58
00:18:45,126 --> 00:18:47,439
[phone rings]
I spank you like a red-headed stepchild.

59
00:18:50,409 --> 00:18:51,869
Oh no you didn't!

60
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,852
Can't believe you stick my spot.

61
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:59,175
Oh, is this your spot?

62
00:18:59,217 --> 00:19:01,567
You're dirty. You're dirty. Damn it.

63
00:19:37,012 --> 00:19:38,159
(Hi Rachel)

64
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,778
Morning fellows.

65
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:41,120
(Good morning)

66
00:19:49,268 --> 00:19:50,618
I made brownies!

67
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:51,935
Who wants some?

68
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,060
You don't have to do that.

69
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,285
I had to park 4 blocks away.

70
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:10,280
Well. Now you've had your cardio.

71
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,143
Those are the last of the brownies,
isn't it?

72
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:16,561
I didn't even get one.

73
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,792
Oh, honey...
You've to watch your girlish figure.

74
00:20:21,485 --> 00:20:22,586
It's not fair Rachel.

75
00:20:23,103 --> 00:20:24,418
You know I wanted a brownie.

76
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,835
George, life's not fair.

77
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,094
That's one hell of a woman.

78
00:20:31,445 --> 00:20:33,290
One hell of a good cook.

79
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:36,369
Yeah, well you try being married
to her for 6 years.

80
00:20:36,418 --> 00:20:37,328
Rachel: SEVEN!

81
00:20:38,383 --> 00:20:41,691
I'm sorry the lack of sex
is making my memory blurry.

82
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:47,730
[beep]

83
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,230
Sorry you got to remove
all metal from your pockets.

84
00:20:58,181 --> 00:20:59,582
[beep]

85
00:20:59,768 --> 00:21:00,853
All metal.

86
00:21:08,332 --> 00:21:09,032
[beep]

87
00:21:09,032 --> 00:21:10,522
Looks like we're gonna be
a little more thorough.

88
00:21:10,522 --> 00:21:11,032
Ah!

89
00:21:12,652 --> 00:21:15,482
Sam, it's time
for a deep body cavity search.

90
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,660
Agent X: So there I was...

91
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:33,010
...surrounded by the enemy...

92
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:35,100
...deep in the jungles of Bolivia...

93
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:38,030
...unarmed and then suddenly I...

94
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:41,810
Agent Z?

95
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:42,640
Yes Sir.

96
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,890
You're late.

97
00:21:45,584 --> 00:21:49,652
Yes Sir,
there was a malfunction at security.

98
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:51,850
I apologize Sir.

99
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:53,259
- Malfunction...?
- Yeah.

100
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:56,300
I'll tell you what though...

101
00:21:57,479 --> 00:21:59,802
I've got a big mission for you.

102
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,600
What?

103
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:05,111
(Yes Sir)

104
00:22:05,879 --> 00:22:07,818
Go down to the break room

105
00:22:09,003 --> 00:22:10,560
and give me a cup of coffee.

106
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,740
[laughs]

107
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,769
You know how I like it.

108
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:26,269
As I was saying,
bullets buzzing over my head.

109
00:22:26,726 --> 00:22:27,477
I had no weapon.

110
00:22:27,493 --> 00:22:31,210
Suddenly, from the canopy above,
came the enemy: *zeeee*.

111
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,001
- Hi!
- Argh!

112
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:53,780
Oh... Hi Amy.

113
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:58,321
Ah, sorry,
I didn't mean to startle you.

114
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:01,970
No, it's okay,
it's a...  I'm a little on edge.

115
00:23:02,978 --> 00:23:03,961
Too much caffeine.

116
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,100
Well, I must compliment you
on your cat-like reflexes.

117
00:23:09,785 --> 00:23:10,419
Oh...

118
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:14,169
Yeah, I was... uh...

119
00:23:14,169 --> 00:23:16,227
Comes with being a secret agent.

120
00:23:17,527 --> 00:23:19,999
I'll have to be a little bit
more careful around you.

121
00:23:20,661 --> 00:23:24,579
I didn't know
you could be so... dangerous.

122
00:23:26,167 --> 00:23:29,003
Yeah, that's... that's me:
dangerous you know.

123
00:23:29,402 --> 00:23:31,480
You could... lose an eye.

124
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:32,940
[laughs]

125
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,843
Hmm... Speaking of danger,
I have something to show you.

126
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:39,510
Won't you come in?

127
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,340
How... cool!

128
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:23,429
(Wow)

129
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:29,081
[amazed laughs]

130
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,380
This is cool!

131
00:24:35,581 --> 00:24:36,803
What does this do?

132
00:24:37,477 --> 00:24:38,881
Oh, be careful with that,

133
00:24:38,881 --> 00:24:40,841
I'm having a lot of problems with it.

134
00:24:40,841 --> 00:24:43,811
[George's smelling]
It contains nerve gas, but it keeps leaking.

135
00:25:09,639 --> 00:25:11,352
A mini supercomputer.

136
00:25:12,693 --> 00:25:15,111
Complete. With wireless internet.

137
00:25:15,111 --> 00:25:17,193
Digital camera.

138
00:25:17,943 --> 00:25:19,443
MP3 player.

139
00:25:20,717 --> 00:25:23,490
Cigarette lighter. Even an AM/FM radio.

140
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,080
Can I have it?

141
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,285
No.

142
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:33,728
What's this?

143
00:25:35,388 --> 00:25:36,235
Hum...

144
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:39,267
That's...

145
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:43,719
That's... That's my vibrator.

146
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,330
So you're planning on doing
a little fly-fishing?

147
00:25:49,894 --> 00:25:50,643
Oh that?

148
00:25:50,926 --> 00:25:52,301
That is my pride and joy.

149
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,152
It's impenetrable.

150
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,469
Watch.

151
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:00,402
[gunshot]

152
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:01,351
Wow!

153
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:07,660
You're crazy.

154
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:11,535
Watch this.

155
00:26:14,285 --> 00:26:15,334
[sound of arrow]

156
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:22,299
Okay, I get it.

157
00:26:23,299 --> 00:26:25,095
This vest is specially designed.

158
00:26:25,369 --> 00:26:28,167
to increase the adrenaline
and testosterone of its wearer.

159
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,568
Giving him more strength, endurance.

160
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:33,686
Even enabling him to run faster.

161
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,350
Well you think he could've made it
a little bit more fashionable.

162
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:39,180
I mean it looks like a fishing vest.

163
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,177
Do I look like
I know anything about fashion?

164
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,890
Oh..! No no no, you know...

165
00:26:47,229 --> 00:26:49,187
No, the vest works. It's um...

166
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,719
You know it's just got lots of...
...convenient pockets.

167
00:26:55,329 --> 00:26:57,044
It has an internal cooling system.

168
00:26:57,426 --> 00:27:00,293
that regulates body temperature
and increases stamina.

169
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,600
Imagine what that could do
for you under fire.

170
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:05,520
Just think what it could do
for me in the bedroom.

171
00:27:06,353 --> 00:27:08,041
I already have.

172
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:15,521
George: [um-um]

173
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:17,912
This is my latest invention:

174
00:27:17,912 --> 00:27:19,068
Training goggles.

175
00:27:19,949 --> 00:27:23,519
It can create virtually
any situation imaginable.

176
00:27:24,034 --> 00:27:24,850
Really?

177
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:27,010
From flying to combat. Try.

178
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:31,440
(Okay)

179
00:27:37,286 --> 00:27:37,870
Wow.

180
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:46,130
That's cool. You do anything?

181
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:47,350
Anything.

182
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:49,603
- Anything?
- Anything.

183
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,570
You want to ***.

184
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,950
You don't know how long it's been.

185
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,870
Oh god you're naughty.

186
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,000
Oh yes George take it.

187
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,610
You know you've always wanted
that tight little fucking ass of mine.

188
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:24,330
Alright in that tight fucking ass?

189
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:11,953
Okay, that was a little weird.

190
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:15,080
You don't know how long
I've waited for that.

191
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,160
You tricked me!?

192
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:20,000
You lured me down here
to take advantage of me.

193
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,379
You... you gadget siren.

194
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:27,751
Oh... So...?

195
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,500
Oh come on you know I like you.

196
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,727
I'm married, I feel so violated.

197
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:35,950
It wasn't real.

198
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,310
Felt real!

199
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,340
Don't! Don't touch me!

200
00:35:41,585 --> 00:35:42,430
Predator.

201
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,630
[Rachel's smelling]

202
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,850
- Where have you been?
- Huh? What?

203
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:24,026
You've been gone over an hour.

204
00:36:24,527 --> 00:36:25,776
X was looking for you.

205
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:27,570
He was?

206
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:30,130
Yeah. He needed his coffee.

207
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:32,000
Oh, yeah, right.

208
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:35,950
So?

209
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:39,851
- So what?
Rachel: So where were you?

210
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,636
I was taking care of business
in the lab.

211
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:48,302
Business, huh?

212
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:53,302
And was this "business"
wearing a white lab coat.

213
00:36:53,894 --> 00:36:56,794
and reeking
a fake designer perfume?

214
00:36:57,226 --> 00:36:58,500
What are you talking about?

215
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,893
Don't play stupid with me, George.

216
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:02,485
That little trollop, Amy.

217
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:03,735
What about her?

218
00:37:04,936 --> 00:37:06,526
George I'm serious.

219
00:37:06,551 --> 00:37:12,000
I know that you know that she knows
that we're... having marital issues.

220
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:15,150
She's like a vulture waiting
on the wings.

221
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:18,390
You're a crazy Lady.

222
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:20,370
Haha. I'm crazy?

223
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:21,780
I'M CRAZY?

224
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,760
I'm not the one was provoked
by a glass of milk this morning

225
00:37:25,168 --> 00:37:27,661
I'm not the one that hassled
the security guards,

226
00:37:27,743 --> 00:37:31,229
and we won't even discuss your bouts
of mourning road rage

227
00:37:31,759 --> 00:37:32,359
WHAT??

228
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,250
I did not harass those security guards

229
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:37,500
you set me up, and for your information

230
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,485
they proceeded
to get very intimate with me

231
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,443
I guess I should be grateful

232
00:37:41,716 --> 00:37:44,160
because it's the closest thing I'm
head to sex in months

233
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,444
There you go again,
always with the sex

234
00:37:47,942 --> 00:37:50,694
We know what George?
Maybe if you learn a little technique

235
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:53,684
instead of humping me
like a drunken Chihuahua

236
00:37:53,769 --> 00:37:56,535
I would be a little more
willing to participate

237
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,703
- Really?
- Yeah!

238
00:37:57,811 --> 00:37:58,694
Really?

239
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,160
Is there a problem here?

240
00:38:00,183 --> 00:38:01,700
Together: NO SIR

241
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,980
Good

242
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:09,090
Rachel, I would like to see you alone,
please

243
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,602
Absolutely

244
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:14,719
- Z?
- Yes?

245
00:38:14,978 --> 00:38:17,410
- Where's my coffee?
- Coming up, Sir

246
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:22,343
"Where's my coffee?"

247
00:38:31,733 --> 00:38:33,328
Rachel, have a seat

248
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:38,495
I am sitting, Sir

249
00:38:40,085 --> 00:38:40,720
Right

250
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:48,177
Rachel... I need you.

251
00:38:51,109 --> 00:38:52,176
Excuse me?

252
00:38:53,785 --> 00:38:54,627
Your help.

253
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,177
Oh

254
00:38:57,186 --> 00:38:59,518
You're the only one
that I can trust.

255
00:39:00,742 --> 00:39:02,319
I have to go on a secret mission

256
00:39:02,319 --> 00:39:04,980
No one here even knows about it

257
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:12,111
I can't help it, but I have a
feeling it may be my last

258
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:13,659
Really, Sir?

259
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:17,452
I don't think there's any coming back
from this one, kid

260
00:39:17,784 --> 00:39:18,500
Sir...

261
00:39:19,001 --> 00:39:19,687
Don't cry

262
00:39:22,001 --> 00:39:23,294
It's the terrorists

263
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,308
The Middle Eastern ones

264
00:39:26,243 --> 00:39:27,394
You know... those guys...

265
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,994
mm-hmm

266
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,387
They've developed
a plan to destroy the world

267
00:39:31,802 --> 00:39:36,536
and I have to go and steal the magic
ingredients to the weapon

268
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,203
(Ah... weapons)

269
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,828
- Rachel?
- Yes, Sir?

270
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:46,169
X:
I need you to help me save the world

271
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,486
Rachel: Huh... The whole world?

272
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:52,101
Can you do that? Can you be a hero?

273
00:39:53,319 --> 00:39:54,393
Yes, Sir

274
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:58,562
Good

275
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,411
Here's what I need for you to do

276
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:07,770
Take this cellphone,
guard it with your life

277
00:40:08,502 --> 00:40:10,501
I'm going to be meeting my contacts

278
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:12,278
and they are very dangerous men

279
00:40:12,359 --> 00:40:15,662
and they are going to want to know
that I am who I say I am

280
00:40:17,294 --> 00:40:18,095
Do you understand?

281
00:40:20,267 --> 00:40:21,287
Not really, Sir

282
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,502
Gonna take me into custody

283
00:40:24,751 --> 00:40:27,469
They're gonna dial that phone
for a code

284
00:40:28,362 --> 00:40:31,394
If you don't give him that code,
or you don't answer that phone

285
00:40:32,823 --> 00:40:33,668
I'll be killed

286
00:40:36,602 --> 00:40:37,634
Now you understand?

287
00:40:39,034 --> 00:40:40,450
Rachel: Huh... I think so, Sir

288
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:42,668
X: Protect that with your life

289
00:40:44,443 --> 00:40:47,561
From now on, you shall be known
as agent...

290
00:40:49,842 --> 00:40:50,462
..."D"

291
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,477
Rachel: "D"?

292
00:40:54,301 --> 00:40:55,302
Any questions?

293
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,304
What's the code word?

294
00:40:59,118 --> 00:40:59,886
Code word?

295
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:01,487
Right

296
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,220
Huh...

297
00:41:04,176 --> 00:41:06,144
Hmm... "Peppermint"

298
00:41:08,327 --> 00:41:09,111
"Peppermint"?

299
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:10,569
X: "Peppermint"

300
00:41:12,868 --> 00:41:13,542
Now go.

301
00:41:15,067 --> 00:41:17,303
I've to prepare
for this kind of mission

302
00:41:17,385 --> 00:41:18,019
But Sir...

303
00:41:18,026 --> 00:41:20,862
[X: tears in voice] Please. Go.

304
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:28,950
Hmm?

305
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:30,310
Uh! George!

306
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:31,552
What... What are you doing?

307
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:34,787
Here you go, Sir

308
00:41:38,176 --> 00:41:39,510
You know I like two sugars

309
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:46,353
You're dismissed

310
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,480
[George is laughing slowly]

311
00:41:57,650 --> 00:41:58,650
What's so funny?

312
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:01,010
You don't actually believe that
secret mission crap, do you?

313
00:42:01,881 --> 00:42:02,471
Rachel: hmm

314
00:42:02,572 --> 00:42:03,635
Oh my god, you do!

315
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,887
That's the oldest trick
in the book

316
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:07,326
He just wants to fuck you

317
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:09,877
You're jealous

318
00:42:10,227 --> 00:42:11,860
Jealous that I got a mission

319
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:13,729
You are a secretary

320
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:14,959
No one's gonna give you a mission

321
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,728
I am an administrative assistant

322
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
but I guess you know a thing or two

323
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,101
about not getting missions now,
wouldn't you?

324
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,247
Well, except fetching coffee

325
00:42:25,087 --> 00:42:26,811
Now why would you have to go there,
okay?

326
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:29,434
I was just trying to warn you,
he's trying to get in your pants.

327
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,160
All he'd to do is ask.

328
00:42:32,092 --> 00:42:32,810
What did you say?

329
00:42:33,953 --> 00:42:35,286
I said don't be such an ass

330
00:42:49,644 --> 00:42:51,335
[sigh]

331
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,767
What is it with you
and that fish tank anyway?

332
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:00,720
This is going to be
the perfect underwater ecosystem

333
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:04,560
And I will be its God

334
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:09,119
You are not right

335
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:10,451
Yeah

336
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:13,985
Well at least I'm not waiting by
a phone that's never going to ring

337
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:15,958
It will ring

338
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:18,693
Why don't you have a little faith that
he'll accomplish the mission?

339
00:43:20,728 --> 00:43:21,917
You just don't get it

340
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:23,985
He's not on a secret mission

341
00:43:24,291 --> 00:43:26,859
Nobody knows anything
about a secret mission

342
00:43:26,943 --> 00:43:29,703
That's because it's secret, duh!

343
00:43:30,152 --> 00:43:32,310
Honey, you know nothing of protocol

344
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,043
You really think he would tell a secretary
about a secret mission?

345
00:43:38,976 --> 00:43:41,593
I am an administrative assistant!

346
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,485
Let me see if I get this straight:

347
00:43:46,134 --> 00:43:48,369
The story is there's a group of terrorists

348
00:43:48,577 --> 00:43:50,059
and they've built a bomb

349
00:43:51,034 --> 00:43:52,727
and they've threatened to
blow up the planet Earth

350
00:43:53,559 --> 00:43:56,477
But alas this will be
his last call of duty

351
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,876
And his fate rests squarely
in palms of your hands

352
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:02,833
You're the only one he can trust

353
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,167
His last hope

354
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:07,426
Bla bla bla bla bla bla

355
00:44:09,517 --> 00:44:10,740
Rachel: Huh
George: Yeah

356
00:44:11,242 --> 00:44:14,059
Listen, that's a story
he gave his last secretary

357
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,070
Rachel, listen, don't get mad

358
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:18,752
[tazzer sound]
George: Aargh!

359
00:44:20,652 --> 00:44:22,481
[Breathes]

360
00:44:24,935 --> 00:44:27,343
That was totally unnecessary

361
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:31,609
You just... pist because
you're fighting for Agent X.

362
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:34,591
in a faraway tropical island.

363
00:44:34,591 --> 00:44:36,903
...getting his dick sucked by a native girl.

364
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:41,570
Do not make me
tazz you twice in the same night

365
00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:42,450
Okay

366
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:43,450
[tazzer sound]

367
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:45,176

You saw the report, there's no time.

549
01:03:13,751 --> 01:03:15,751
The terrorists are gonna bomb
the US in a couple of days

550
01:03:15,942 --> 01:03:18,070
The British agents are already in route

551
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:20,668
Exactly why we should call for backup

552
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,200
Why? so they could pass the
assignment under somebody else?

553
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:26,590
So I can get overlooked. Again.

554
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:31,581
Rachel, I'm fucking tired of
getting coffee and dry-cleaning

555
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,100
So this is about you?

556
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:33,610
No!

557
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:35,560
(Well... maybe)

558
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:38,399
You selfish jerk

559
01:03:38,399 --> 01:03:41,650
I don't think risking my life
for my government is selfish

560
01:03:41,650 --> 01:03:42,800
It's patriotic

561
01:03:42,990 --> 01:03:44,477
Besides,

562
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:48,130
if you hadn't killed our top operative
I wouldn't be forced to do this

563
01:03:49,535 --> 01:03:51,730
Fine. Well I'm going with you

564
01:03:52,144 --> 01:03:53,901
No. No, no. You're not

565
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,381
You said it yourself:
I'm responsible so I'm going

566
01:03:56,381 --> 01:03:57,231
No way

567
01:03:58,400 --> 01:03:59,652
If you won't let me go, I'm telling.

568
01:04:06,859 --> 01:04:07,870
Fine

569
01:04:08,192 --> 01:04:10,800
Yes! My first mission as an agent

570
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:13,327
You're not an agent.
You're a secretary

571
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:18,650
I am an administrative assistant

572
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:26,990
Did you hear that? Terrorist

573
01:04:27,609 --> 01:04:28,660
I got to call Washington.

574
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:30,990
You're not calling anyone my dear

575
01:04:33,250 --> 01:04:35,052

You don't even know a code.

581
01:05:21,300 --> 01:05:21,980
Um

582
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:25,160
How did you do that?

583
01:05:27,225 --> 01:05:28,452
Honey, you forget:

584
01:05:28,935 --> 01:05:32,111
in addition
to being able to type 87 words a minute

585
01:05:32,111 --> 01:05:34,061

Grab the bag

591
01:06:00,950 --> 01:06:03,119
Oh yeah, you're mine now

592
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:29,150
George, I really don't think there's
gonna be time for fishing

593
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:32,240
This isn't a fishing vest

594
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:35,668
This is a high-tech fight
enhancing super vest

595
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:38,760
Right. You know you don't have
to make shit up, George

596

That's what I'm talking about

599

Is that
one of those penis extension things?

600
01:06:55,143 --> 01:06:55,760
What?

601
01:06:56,100 --> 01:06:58,443
Feeling a little "inferior"?
Are you, George?

602
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:02,190
I'm surprised
you even remember that I have a penis

603

604

609
01:07:28,027 --> 01:07:30,312
How the hell
do you expect me to defend myself?

01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:38,969
You've got to be kidding me

Listen: go to the house pack a few things.

613
01:07:43,410 --> 01:07:48,390
I'm gonna go try and secure it right
in here for something... inconspicuous.

614

Try not to shoot yourself

615
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:07,650
What is all this?

616
01:08:08,085 --> 01:08:09,201

617
01:08:09,857 --> 01:08:12,019
Okay.
Do you understand we're going undercover?

618

Yeah

619
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:15,830
That's why I need so many disguises. Duh!

Okay. You know, fine. Have it your way

This is our inconspicuous ride?

625
01:08:33,059 --> 01:08:35,076
No one's ever gonna guess
where we're going

626
01:08:35,142 --> 01:08:36,293
Rachel, just get in the van.

627
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:38,426
Fine. Get the bags

628

Uh... Okay...

01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,419
Definitely, my favorite dress in there.

729
01:23:22,700 --> 01:23:24,840
Aargh... Virgins here I come

730
01:23:28,850 --> 01:23:29,860
Sweetie...!

731
01:23:30,202 --> 01:23:32,418
Oh my God, that's awesome.

732
01:23:33,551 --> 01:23:34,443
I didn't know that

733
01:23:40,679 --> 01:23:41,943
Run!

734
01:23:43,850 --> 01:23:45,829
Oh that's just dirty.

735
01:23:59,401 --> 01:24:00,068
Can we go now?

736
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:01,469
Yeah

737
01:24:05,850 --> 01:24:08,091
Honey? A little help, come on

738
01:24:14,250 --> 01:24:14,860
Uh...

739
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:16,403
Here's your bag, sweetie.

740
01:24:29,610 --> 01:24:31,880

[Traditional arabic music]

742
01:26:03,900 --> 01:26:06,776
Haha, this had better be good

743
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:11,930
Efendi, I have located
the agent south of the palace

744
01:26:12,050 --> 01:26:14,300
but these are different from the rest

745
01:26:15,167 --> 01:26:16,569
They want us to know they are here

746
01:26:17,403 --> 01:26:18,718
It's like they are taunting us

747
01:26:20,310 --> 01:26:22,159
and I think they have
the American agent with them

748
01:26:22,744 --> 01:26:25,026
Only he would be so bold

749
01:26:25,700 --> 01:26:27,777
I think his name is X

750
01:26:29,983 --> 01:26:31,301
Hold on a second

751
01:26:32,060 --> 01:26:33,910
[Hussein coughs]

752
01:26:36,580 --> 01:26:41,430
Agent X is here and you're sure?

753
01:26:42,250 --> 01:26:43,892
He took out some of our best men

754
01:26:44,360 --> 01:26:45,127
It's got to be him

755
01:26:45,823 --> 01:26:48,350
But we've captured a prisoner

756
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:50,450
(Find Abdul,)

757
01:26:50,500 --> 01:26:52,871
tell him to double the guard
watch and get out there

758
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,610
I want to know everything
they're doing

759
01:26:54,644 --> 01:26:56,143
They take a shit
I want to know about it

760
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,779
Okay, they take a crap I don't
need to know about that

761
01:26:58,779 --> 01:27:00,883
But anything else I'm gonna know about it,
you understand?

762
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,380
And you interrogate the prisonner, okay?

763
01:27:03,735 --> 01:27:05,690
- Yes Effendi
- Go

764
01:27:19,670 --> 01:27:22,020
This room is very beautiful

765
01:27:22,921 --> 01:27:29,419
It must certainly is,
but not as beautiful as you

766
01:27:31,450 --> 01:27:36,840
Your beauty is as expansive as the desert

767
01:27:40,100 --> 01:27:43,590
You are like an oasis

768
01:27:47,500 --> 01:27:48,410
Oh...

769
01:27:50,500 --> 01:27:51,880
Look at me

770
01:28:03,900 --> 01:28:05,720
Do not fear my power

771
01:28:14,700 --> 01:28:15,780
What?

772
01:28:17,060 --> 01:28:18,850
Oh!

773
01:28:19,829 --> 01:28:21,640
My maid must have left this. Nevermind

774
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:26,620
Look into my eyes.
I want your passion

775
01:39:49,861 --> 01:39:52,030
You're so powerful

776
01:39:52,720 --> 01:39:55,430
- The treasures ***
- Abdul!

777
01:39:58,000 --> 01:39:59,119
Abdul!

778
01:39:59,890 --> 01:40:01,530
I've been looking all over
the palace for you.

779
01:40:01,530 --> 01:40:03,120
What are you doing in my room?

780
01:40:04,120 --> 01:40:05,700
(This is not your room?)

781
01:40:07,470 --> 01:40:09,420
And what is Teddy doing on the floor?

782
01:40:23,403 --> 01:40:24,784
Let... Let me explain...

783
01:40:25,202 --> 01:40:26,535
Explain what?

784
01:40:26,550 --> 01:40:29,570
That you have one of Hussein's
concubines in my bed?

785
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,240
If he finds out
he'll cut off both our balls

786
01:40:32,621 --> 01:40:33,761
I will not tell

787
01:40:34,371 --> 01:40:35,794
You know what? Begone with yourself

788
01:40:36,150 --> 01:40:37,990
Be out of here before someone sees you

789
01:40:38,600 --> 01:40:43,000
Yes... A thousand pardons... [arabic]

790
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,470
I should kick your ass, but I have no time

791
01:40:45,470 --> 01:40:47,340
Hussein needs us. Dress quickly

792
01:41:08,217 --> 01:41:08,743
Huh.

793
01:41:09,828 --> 01:41:11,064
Wait a minute.

794
01:41:12,810 --> 01:41:14,490
Some of my cases are missing

795
01:41:16,830 --> 01:41:20,200
And where's Muffy?
Has anybody seen Muffy?

796
01:41:20,200 --> 01:41:21,585
What's a "muffy"?

797
01:41:22,500 --> 01:41:25,880
Muffy's my baby!
We have to go find Muffy

798
01:41:26,895 --> 01:41:28,860
She could be in the desert all by herself

799
01:41:28,900 --> 01:41:32,109
Rachel, get a hold of yourself.
We CANNOT go back

800
01:41:32,754 --> 01:41:35,860
Alright? There's no way she'd survive
the heat of the desert

801
01:41:36,520 --> 01:41:37,390
She's the casualty of war

These are the new summer collection

805
01:41:58,475 --> 01:41:58,977
See.

806
01:41:59,172 --> 01:42:01,102
See how easily she forgot about Muffy

807
01:42:02,609 --> 01:42:04,090
You know that could be me out there

808
01:42:04,678 --> 01:42:08,452
I though she you'd knew the difference...
but married 6 years.

809
01:42:09,137 --> 01:42:10,110
Seven!

810
01:42:10,987 --> 01:42:12,221

Ooh

814
01:42:35,950 --> 01:42:38,700
Watson, this is not what I had in mind

815
01:42:39,700 --> 01:42:41,050
You've been
on that damn thing all night, sir.

816
01:42:41,050 --> 01:42:42,250
surely it's my turn to ride

817
01:42:42,250 --> 01:42:44,870
Soon Watson, soon.
Remember those hostiles everywhere

818
01:42:44,950 --> 01:42:46,260
I must keep a lookout

819
01:42:47,500 --> 01:42:47,980
Oh

820
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,070
- What is it?
- I see something in the distance

821
01:42:51,400 --> 01:42:51,850
Where?

822
01:42:51,850 --> 01:42:53,600
Look alike southeast of our position

823
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:54,789
Pass me my lens

824
01:42:58,000 --> 01:42:59,859
What do you see?
What is it?

825
01:43:12,250 --> 01:43:14,510
I don't quite know Watson.
I can't make it out

826
01:43:15,300 --> 01:43:16,481
Good God

827
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:18,770
I think the hit
he's gotten to me man

[aaargh (George's making a big effort)]

829
01:43:40,100 --> 01:43:41,970
Stop trying to force it, George.

830
01:43:43,500 --> 01:43:44,830
It's really tight

831
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:46,650

Now where the hell were you today?

841
01:44:24,290 --> 01:44:26,010
You could have cost us the mission, man

842
01:44:26,010 --> 01:44:28,600
What?
I made my pickup I don't understand

843

Wooo... I like your camel!

01:44:36,490 --> 01:44:38,090
Are you guys on a mission too?

850
01:44:38,810 --> 01:44:40,720

I'm sorry this is my husband Geroge

He watches the mission files
in our building

855
01:44:53,101 --> 01:44:55,280
And I am the director's administrative
assistant, Rachel

856

fellows who sent me the fax

Pleased to meet you folks

858
01:44:59,380 --> 01:45:02,030
Good God what are you both doing here?

859
01:45:02,510 --> 01:45:04,670
This is a Code Red top-secret mission

860
01:45:05,050 --> 01:45:06,720
Not a sightseeing tour

861
01:45:07,535 --> 01:45:09,203
Okay, we'll take it from here

862
01:45:09,460 --> 01:45:12,380
You two, back in the camp while
we'll do recon of the area,

863
01:45:12,380 --> 01:45:14,280
and 0500 hours okay(?)

864
01:45:14,350 --> 01:45:16,590
Yes. Stay close to your tents

865
01:45:17,140 --> 01:45:19,500
Oh, don't get in our way

866
01:45:19,500 --> 01:45:22,220
- Hey, I think we can be of service
- Yeah

867
01:45:24,100 --> 01:45:25,490
Yes I think you might

868
01:45:25,900 --> 01:45:27,850
Be a good man and go make me
a nice cup of tea.

869
01:45:27,850 --> 01:45:29,670
I'm rather parched.

870
01:45:30,867 --> 01:45:33,720
Honey, your reputation precedes you

871
01:45:33,950 --> 01:45:34,960
Shut up Rachel

872
01:45:35,800 --> 01:45:38,910
So not really gonna stay in our tent
to let them have all the fun, are we?

873
01:45:40,200 --> 01:45:41,180
Yeah.

874
01:45:41,300 --> 01:45:46,150
Those limey bastards... Who they think they are?
Secret agents or something?

875
01:45:47,450 --> 01:45:50,190
Uuuuh... They are

876
01:45:50,941 --> 01:45:52,351
Oh... yeah... right

877
01:45:53,427 --> 01:45:54,110
Oh...

878
01:45:55,460 --> 01:45:56,734
I have an idea

879
01:45:57,010 --> 01:45:58,130
You know what we should do?

880
01:45:58,300 --> 01:46:00,660
We should get that nerve gas
that you had

881
01:46:00,660 --> 01:46:04,450
and put it in their tent and then,
after they're asleep,

882
01:46:04,450 --> 01:46:07,280
We can go to the palace and steal
the map to the warehouse

883
01:46:07,500 --> 01:46:09,020
That's a great idea

884
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:12,870
Why do I have to go 
gas him in the tent?

885
01:46:14,050 --> 01:46:15,800
I thought you were the leader

886
01:46:15,800 --> 01:46:18,120
and if I was a leader that's
what I would do

887
01:46:19,100 --> 01:46:20,140
Yes, of course

888
01:46:20,860 --> 01:46:21,770
I knew that

889
01:46:22,181 --> 01:46:24,430
I was just testing you, and you did well

890
01:46:25,400 --> 01:46:26,810
I want to go prepare the equipment

891
01:46:37,100 --> 01:46:38,670
Who do you work for?

892
01:46:40,850 --> 01:46:41,970
Tell me who sent you

893
01:46:44,950 --> 01:46:46,801
Where is the camp?

894
01:46:49,090 --> 01:46:51,350
Your silence only angers me

895
01:46:58,300 --> 01:46:58,921
Oh!

896
01:46:58,921 --> 01:47:00,451
Look at the will(?)

897
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:02,860
Dog. Little dog

898
01:47:03,200 --> 01:47:05,070
Hum. Leave the prisoner with me

899
01:47:06,691 --> 01:47:07,185
Thank you

900
01:47:08,100 --> 01:47:09,519
- Pfff
- Dismissed

901
01:47:11,803 --> 01:47:13,950
We'll get the will(?) puppy wuppy

902
01:47:14,250 --> 01:47:16,809
You're so sweet
I think I'll name you Jihad

904
01:47:18,680 --> 01:47:22,027
So that's the way, uh-ha uh-ha,
I like it

[*noise of camera taking a photo*]

907
01:47:52,450 --> 01:47:53,990
Which tent do you think they're in?

908
01:47:55,700 --> 01:47:57,180
I think it's that one

909
01:47:57,510 --> 01:47:58,767
- That one?
- Yeah

910
01:47:58,912 --> 01:48:00,482
With the Union Jack?

911
01:48:01,172 --> 01:48:03,622
- Yeah I think so
- That's a good guess

912
01:48:03,622 --> 01:48:04,342
- Yeah
- Yeah, okay.

913
01:49:02,552 --> 01:49:05,970
[*gas is leaking*]

914
01:49:30,592 --> 01:49:32,272
Guys, remember:

915
01:49:32,272 --> 01:49:34,600
The only way inside the palace office,

916
01:49:34,600 --> 01:49:36,010
without setting off the alarm,

917
01:49:36,010 --> 01:49:37,253
is going to be through the roof

918
01:49:37,700 --> 01:49:38,970
Once you're inside,

919
01:49:38,970 --> 01:49:41,460
the map is going to be
inside the desk

920
01:49:41,850 --> 01:49:42,520
- Got it?
- Okay

921
01:49:42,920 --> 01:49:43,670
Got it

922
01:49:56,252 --> 01:49:57,252
[body felt on the floor]

923
01:50:07,400 --> 01:50:08,410
Honey?

924
01:50:08,410 --> 01:50:10,290
How did you get in here?

925
01:50:10,820 --> 01:50:12,690
Front door. It's unlocked

926
01:50:25,150 --> 01:50:25,819
Okay

927
01:50:26,400 --> 01:50:28,251
- I'm gonna find the office
- Okay

928
01:50:44,600 --> 01:50:45,510
It's this way

929
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:46,540
Okay

930
01:50:47,500 --> 01:50:48,450
Rachel, wait

931
01:50:48,830 --> 01:50:50,250
You set off the alarm.

932
01:51:23,600 --> 01:51:25,480
That was amazing

933
01:51:26,100 --> 01:51:28,330
Did you forget
how flexible my body is?

934
01:51:29,340 --> 01:51:32,160
Well considering the fact that
you never let me see it anymore

935
01:51:32,160 --> 01:51:34,370
I've forgotten quite a few
things about your body

936
01:51:35,200 --> 01:51:37,440
Not now, George. Really

937
01:52:08,301 --> 01:52:09,551
It's locked

938
01:52:23,750 --> 01:52:24,530
- George?
- Uh?

939
01:52:24,950 --> 01:52:26,040
I found it

940
01:52:26,300 --> 01:52:27,670
- Lets get out of there
- Okay

01:52:27,850 --> 01:52:28,750

943
01:52:32,500 --> 01:52:33,530
Come on Rachel

944
01:52:34,450 --> 01:52:36,650
- Go, go
- There's a problem George

945
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:55,800
[*gunshots*]

946
01:53:35,550 --> 01:53:37,010
Oh...

947
01:53:39,400 --> 01:53:41,390
Watson, the full of my head's been
bashed in

948
01:53:43,790 --> 01:53:45,050
I think it was this, sir

949
01:53:47,300 --> 01:53:48,820
Those damned Americans

950
01:53:49,350 --> 01:53:50,740
They're gonna get us killed, Watson

951
01:53:52,250 --> 01:53:53,830
They think they're Cowboys or something

952
01:53:54,830 --> 01:53:56,361
Too much television I'd say

953
01:54:10,900 --> 01:54:12,480
What the hell was you thinking?

954
01:54:12,594 --> 01:54:13,928
You're gonna get us all killed

955
01:54:14,250 --> 01:54:15,500
This isn't a game

956
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:17,490
You do anything like that again,

957
01:54:17,490 --> 01:54:18,050
and I will...

958
01:54:18,050 --> 01:54:19,080
You'll what?

959
01:54:20,200 --> 01:54:22,452
I'll be forced to kill you

960
01:54:23,310 --> 01:54:25,449

Ha ha ha

01:54:31,200 --> 01:54:32,610
That's smart, doesn't it?

964
01:54:32,610 --> 01:54:34,770
Oh you gotta watch her with that,
she's like a ninja

965
01:54:38,320 --> 01:54:39,859
Anything you'd like to add?

966
01:54:49,450 --> 01:54:50,740
We got the map

967
01:54:51,800 --> 01:54:54,490
You what? Well done!

968
01:54:54,850 --> 01:54:56,290

Yes, yes, we need your help

Oh, and I also got you this

On here you'll find all the

to get you safely into the palace

975
01:55:18,541 --> 01:55:20,551
Excellent work my dear

976
01:55:23,061 --> 01:55:25,181
What the hell happened to you, man?

977
01:55:25,851 --> 01:55:29,191
Oh well I had to take out a couple
of guards too

978
01:55:29,750 --> 01:55:33,200
In fact I killed them with my bare hands

979
01:55:33,400 --> 01:55:36,511
I got rid of the bodies,
I dragged them far away

980
01:55:36,560 --> 01:55:39,970
They'll never be found so, you know,
you don't have to worry

981
01:55:39,970 --> 01:55:41,180
Won't come back on you

982
01:55:42,450 --> 01:55:45,070
Yes. Quite the hero he was

983
01:55:46,070 --> 01:55:49,070
Oh. Good job, man.
I was wrong about you

984
01:55:49,350 --> 01:55:51,250
I thought you were just a pen pusher

985
01:55:52,650 --> 01:55:54,890
Well... We got lots of training to do

986
01:55:54,890 --> 01:55:57,621
We've to go over the intel reports
that Rachel gather.

987
01:56:04,241 --> 01:56:06,021
Argh... Watson?

988
01:56:06,300 --> 01:56:07,020
Yes?

989
01:56:07,020 --> 01:56:08,900
That's one tough burd(?), Watson.

990
01:56:09,650 --> 01:56:11,020
I should say

[♪ camera shutter]

992
01:56:14,250 --> 01:56:15,190
Nice

993
01:56:18,400 --> 01:56:19,701
You're okay, sir?

994
01:56:20,100 --> 01:56:22,180
No. I'm not okay

995
01:56:22,980 --> 01:56:24,180
Get a cup of tea?

996
01:56:24,500 --> 01:56:25,300
Two sugars

997
01:56:25,300 --> 01:56:26,620
Yeah, ok, I go get some, sir

998
01:56:34,167 --> 01:56:35,986
Let's go! Ladies,
let's look alive here.

999
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:37,290
Let's go, move it, push it up,

01:56:37,300 --> 01:56:38,600
yeah, that's right Jackson

1001
01:56:38,600 --> 01:56:40,300
Move it, up and down, up and down

1002
01:56:40,730 --> 01:56:42,020
Watson, good job!

1003
01:56:54,600 --> 01:56:55,980
Go, go, go

1004
01:57:11,900 --> 01:57:12,810
I'm okay!

1005
01:57:24,950 --> 01:57:25,990
I'm okay!

Okay, now listen up

1008
01:57:57,500 --> 01:57:59,490
Me and Watson will take out
the palace guards here

1009
01:57:59,700 --> 01:58:00,600
and here

Moving forward to the throne room
and take out Husein

Go to the warehouse
and disarm the weapon,

1016
01:58:15,600 --> 01:58:16,820
Now don't mess this up

1017
01:58:16,820 --> 01:58:18,000
Is everyone clear?

1018
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:18,690
Yes, sir

1019
01:58:18,690 --> 01:58:19,610
Good

01:58:22,400 --> 01:58:23,510
Watson, what are you doing?

1021
01:58:24,050 --> 01:58:25,470
Something to remember our trip together

1022
01:58:25,470 --> 01:58:26,400
Good God, man.

1023
01:58:26,400 --> 01:58:28,650
This is not a bloody lads holidays,
this is a mission

1024
01:58:28,650 --> 01:58:29,461
Now move out

1025
01:58:32,491 --> 01:58:35,431
Not that cheap, it's almost paid off(?)

1026
01:59:11,700 --> 01:59:13,730
- Nicely done(?), sir.
- Thank You Watson.

1027
01:59:17,250 --> 01:59:18,220
Listen Watson,

1028
01:59:18,340 --> 01:59:20,900
We have the element of surprise on our side.
Any idea?

1029
01:59:20,900 --> 01:59:22,410
we can't going guns blazing.

1030
01:59:22,800 --> 01:59:25,109
So you have your silencer?
And knife

1031
01:59:25,600 --> 01:59:28,241
Then you go on fire, and kill anyone
you come across

1032
01:59:28,750 --> 01:59:29,300
Anyone?

1033
01:59:29,300 --> 01:59:32,040
Yes. Anyone, man,
if you want to get out alive.

1034
01:59:32,650 --> 01:59:34,490
- Is that clear?
- Crystal

Oh my God...

1039
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:15,180
I've died and gone to heaven

1040
02:00:15,300 --> 02:00:17,340
Don't worry, I'll take out this

1041
02:00:17,340 --> 02:00:18,470
What are you doing, man?

1042
02:00:18,900 --> 02:00:20,500
You forgot your training?

1043
02:00:20,500 --> 02:00:21,700
Hostiles, sir

1044
02:00:22,150 --> 02:00:23,560
Kill anyone I see

1045
02:00:23,560 --> 02:00:25,281
It's them or me, that's what you said

1046
02:00:25,400 --> 02:00:27,870
Goodness me, have you forgot what
is to be a British agent?

1047
02:00:28,600 --> 02:00:30,230
To protect our fine country, sir

1048
02:00:30,400 --> 02:00:32,511
Oh my God, no no no,
to be licensed to kill,

1049
02:00:32,511 --> 02:00:35,900
and licensed to fuck the finest
women the world has to offer

1050
02:00:36,050 --> 02:00:38,150
Ah...
So this is not the time to kill

1051
02:00:38,150 --> 02:00:38,750
No

1052
02:00:38,900 --> 02:00:39,940
No no no,

1053
02:00:39,940 --> 02:00:42,770
this is time to "party"

1054
02:00:50,671 --> 02:00:52,791
- Yes
- No no no, don't, no

1055
02:00:53,550 --> 02:00:56,000
What are you doing in these chambers,
it is forbidden

1056
02:00:58,550 --> 02:01:00,290
- You can scream and I'll just know it
- Oh...

1057
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:02,060
Don't worry

1058
02:01:02,230 --> 02:01:05,090
We would not alert the guards to
the presence of our rescuers

1059
02:01:06,550 --> 02:01:07,460
Rescuers?

1060
02:01:07,540 --> 02:01:09,419
You're here to rescue us, aren't you?

1061
02:01:09,419 --> 02:01:10,449
Of course we are! Yes,

1062
02:01:10,449 --> 02:01:13,150
Yes, we're here to rescue.
We're just glad you're all in one piece

1063
02:01:13,479 --> 02:01:16,159
We have not seen men like you before

1064
02:01:16,159 --> 02:01:18,000
We only see one man

1065
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,329
Oh... That's nice... I guess

1066
02:01:20,320 --> 02:01:22,920
Nice? Have you seen him?

1067
02:01:27,600 --> 02:01:28,949
Holy Jesus!

1068
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:30,600
Uh... Nasty

1069
02:01:30,600 --> 02:01:31,660
You see?

1070
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:33,250
Well, yes, I do

1071
02:01:35,050 --> 02:01:37,400
Well, we must be awful.
We're gonna clear the palace

1072
02:01:37,450 --> 02:01:38,739
to rescue you of course

1073
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:39,700
Wait!

1074
02:01:39,900 --> 02:01:42,630
You must do one thing for us
before you leave

1075
02:01:43,850 --> 02:01:46,859
You must pleasure us before
you leave this place

1076
02:01:47,500 --> 02:01:49,260
What? All of you?

1077
02:01:50,260 --> 02:01:52,360
My God. I did die and go to heaven

1078
02:12:39,700 --> 02:12:40,802
God damn it

1079
02:12:41,750 --> 02:12:43,080
Hostiles on the road

1080
02:12:44,800 --> 02:12:46,070
What could I do?

1081
02:12:48,050 --> 02:12:49,431
You know, I have an idea

1082
02:12:53,700 --> 02:12:55,010
I want to use the big gun

1083
02:12:55,120 --> 02:12:57,730
Rachel, this is not a big gun,
this is a rocket launcher

1084
02:12:57,850 --> 02:12:59,650
Whatever it is, I want to use it

1085
02:12:59,650 --> 02:13:00,600
- It's my turn
- No, no

1086
02:13:00,600 --> 02:13:02,190
- Yes
- Rachel, no

1087
02:13:02,190 --> 02:13:02,880
Yes

1088
02:13:03,201 --> 02:13:03,921
No

1089
02:13:07,001 --> 02:13:09,931
If you don't let me use it, you never
gonna see my naked body again

1090
02:13:10,700 --> 02:13:12,990
Oh, and that's any different
from now how?

1091
02:13:13,500 --> 02:13:14,981
Aw, just thinking you know,

1092
02:13:14,981 --> 02:13:17,001
it's really hot out here

1093
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:21,510
Look at me... you...
how cute you look in those

1094
02:13:21,510 --> 02:13:23,600
desert camel outfit

1095
02:13:24,500 --> 02:13:25,520
- Good
- Yeah

1096
02:13:26,050 --> 02:13:27,150
You know,

1097
02:13:27,150 --> 02:13:29,230
how much I wanna touch your big,

1098
02:13:29,230 --> 02:13:31,250
hard, rocket?

1099
02:13:31,250 --> 02:13:31,600
[*sigh*]

1100
02:13:31,600 --> 02:13:32,400
[*bang*]

1101
02:13:36,800 --> 02:13:39,560
See George,
that's the problem with you:

1102
02:13:39,650 --> 02:13:41,400
Alyways premature

1103
02:13:41,400 --> 02:13:43,779
Rachel, shut up, come on.
Let's get out of here

1104
02:14:01,350 --> 02:14:03,850
30,000 FEET ABOVE THE EARTH,
EVIL SWOOPS IN

1105
02:14:15,100 --> 02:14:16,700
On the way

1106
02:14:33,489 --> 02:14:35,089
Target acquired.

1107
02:15:23,200 --> 02:15:24,820
Go, go, go

1108
02:15:33,850 --> 02:15:35,610
I think you should try
to make it to the door

1109
02:15:36,400 --> 02:15:37,850
Maybe it's unlocked

1110
02:15:39,500 --> 02:15:40,760
Come on hop with me

1111
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:41,910
Ready?

1112
02:15:45,400 --> 02:15:46,350
What are you doing?

1113
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:49,280
I think we should go by the window

1114
02:15:49,280 --> 02:15:50,780
and yell for help, okay?

1115
02:15:50,900 --> 02:15:53,270
George, that's a stupid idea

1116
02:15:53,590 --> 02:15:54,440
Come on this way

1117
02:15:54,440 --> 02:15:55,021
No

1118
02:15:55,400 --> 02:15:56,570
- This way
- No, this way

1119
02:15:56,570 --> 02:15:58,560
- This way
- This way

1120
02:16:00,241 --> 02:16:01,081
[Together:] - THIS WAY

1121
02:16:01,071 --> 02:16:01,521
No!

1122
02:16:02,050 --> 02:16:02,760
Ah!

1123
02:16:05,641 --> 02:16:07,000
Oh, fuck

1124
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:07,550
(Ouch)

1125
02:16:09,450 --> 02:16:11,090
Idiot...

1126
02:16:14,950 --> 02:16:16,761
I can't believe you blew up Bob's Jeep.

1127
02:16:17,700 --> 02:16:18,420
Me?

1128
02:16:18,800 --> 02:16:19,600
ME?

1129
02:16:20,100 --> 02:16:23,020
I can't fucking believe I brought
you on this mission

1130
02:16:24,150 --> 02:16:25,870
After six years of marriage,

1131
02:16:25,870 --> 02:16:27,800
you think I've learned my lesson,

1132
02:16:27,800 --> 02:16:28,920
but no.

1133
02:16:29,100 --> 02:16:32,419
My dumb ass brings your dumb ass
halfway around the world

1134
02:16:32,419 --> 02:16:34,929
so you can make me look
like a bigger dumbass

1135
02:16:35,260 --> 02:16:36,480
Unbelievable!

1136
02:16:36,800 --> 02:16:37,679
Wow,

1137
02:16:37,679 --> 02:16:39,220
Little pent-up, aren't you?

1138
02:16:39,220 --> 02:16:40,330
- You think.
- *ouch*

1139
02:16:40,740 --> 02:16:42,600
Can a man just get a little head,

1140
02:16:42,600 --> 02:16:43,730
just a little,

1141
02:16:43,730 --> 02:16:47,070
just a little sucky sucky,
a blow job here and there?

1142
02:16:49,500 --> 02:16:50,890
Have you lost your mind?

1143
02:16:50,890 --> 02:16:52,480
Are you crazy?

1144
02:16:53,500 --> 02:16:55,440
We're in this mess because
you blew up the Jeep

1145
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:56,980
[George coughs]

1146
02:16:57,750 --> 02:17:00,130
This- was- your- fault

1147
02:17:01,200 --> 02:17:02,340
My fault?

1148
02:17:02,340 --> 02:17:04,400
How the fuck is this my fault?

1149
02:17:04,890 --> 02:17:09,050
"Oh you're so sexy in the uniform".
Blah blah blah

1150
02:17:09,230 --> 02:17:11,340
If you weren't busy molesting
a rocket launcher,

1151
02:17:11,340 --> 02:17:13,600
I wouldn't have accidentally set it off

1152
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:15,640
Are you kidding me?

1153
02:17:19,700 --> 02:17:20,940
Rachel,

1154
02:17:21,294 --> 02:17:27,230
Do you've any idea how hard it is to be
married to a beautiful woman like you,

1155
02:17:28,230 --> 02:17:30,910
and having guys constantly
vying for your attention,

1156
02:17:30,910 --> 02:17:32,530
trying to impress you?

1157
02:17:37,100 --> 02:17:40,010
I know you want to be with
a successful man,

1158
02:17:40,010 --> 02:17:42,970
like... like Agent X,

1159
02:17:45,200 --> 02:17:47,011
and on top of that,

1160
02:17:48,011 --> 02:17:50,171
you know every day I still want you,

1161
02:17:50,171 --> 02:17:52,841
just as bad and just as passionately,

1162
02:17:53,850 --> 02:17:56,240
as the first day I laid eyes on you

1163
02:17:57,300 --> 02:17:58,620
And you don't seem...

1164
02:18:01,100 --> 02:18:03,310
...to want me... to...

1165
02:18:04,400 --> 02:18:06,209
to want me at all

1166
02:18:08,350 --> 02:18:10,399
That's not true, George

1167
02:18:13,700 --> 02:18:14,820
You're just...

1168
02:18:16,450 --> 02:18:18,500
You're obsessed with your job and...

1169
02:18:19,200 --> 02:18:20,340
[*sigh*]

1170
02:18:21,340 --> 02:18:23,100
getting a mission...

1171
02:18:26,500 --> 02:18:27,670
...it's...

1172
02:18:28,700 --> 02:18:31,440
...it's like I'm not
important to you anymore

1173
02:18:32,650 --> 02:18:34,210
Don't you get it?

1174
02:18:35,700 --> 02:18:37,720
It's because you're important to me

1175
02:18:39,400 --> 02:18:40,440
that I want a mission,

1176
02:18:40,440 --> 02:18:43,900
that I want to keep my head buried
in the work

1177
02:18:44,850 --> 02:18:46,540
I want you to be proud of me,
I want you to...

1178
02:18:46,800 --> 02:18:48,160
I want you to be proud

1179
02:18:48,700 --> 02:18:49,870
walking around with me

1180
02:18:50,950 --> 02:18:51,930
Baby,

1181
02:18:53,100 --> 02:18:54,611
I am proud of you

1182
02:18:54,611 --> 02:18:55,951
You mean it?

1183
02:18:56,681 --> 02:18:58,051
Yes, of course

1184
02:18:59,350 --> 02:19:00,270
I love you

1185
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:04,340
I love you too

1186
02:19:13,450 --> 02:19:15,020
How very touching

1187
02:19:16,150 --> 02:19:17,680
Agent M?

1188
02:19:17,800 --> 02:19:19,300
Don't look so shocked

1189
02:19:19,800 --> 02:19:21,480
And it's Miranda

1190
02:19:21,850 --> 02:19:23,130
(- But why?)

1191
02:19:23,440 --> 02:19:24,950
Uh, money. Why else?

1192
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:26,890
Come.

1193
02:19:26,890 --> 02:19:29,040
I've brought the coordinates
to the White House,

1194
02:19:29,040 --> 02:19:31,451
I'll deal with these lovebirds later

1195
02:19:36,400 --> 02:19:38,060
Always thought she was kind of a bitch

1196
02:19:38,060 --> 02:19:38,920
Yeah

1197
02:19:39,152 --> 02:19:41,800
She'd big monstrous feet too

1198
02:19:42,350 --> 02:19:44,679
I hope the Brits
are having better luck than us

1199
02:19:53,150 --> 02:19:54,840
Hum hum. Sir?

1200
02:19:54,840 --> 02:19:56,170
What is it Watson?

1201
02:19:57,550 --> 02:20:00,730
We're gonna need a damn good
plan to get past his own guards

1202
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:04,000
Yes Watson. I'm on it

1203
02:20:05,300 --> 02:20:07,160
I have an idea

1204
02:20:21,400 --> 02:20:22,450
Are you fidgeting?

1205
02:20:22,640 --> 02:20:23,450
Trust me

1206
02:20:25,900 --> 02:20:27,500
I know that sound

1207
02:20:28,900 --> 02:20:29,710
What is that?

1208
02:20:29,810 --> 02:20:31,130
It's my nail file

1209
02:20:32,100 --> 02:20:33,170
Oh...

1210
02:20:36,100 --> 02:20:37,030
Shit!

1211
02:20:47,950 --> 02:20:49,000
- Are you okay?
- Yeah

1212
02:20:50,350 --> 02:20:51,660
Did you mean what you said?

1213
02:20:51,800 --> 02:20:53,010
Of course I did

1214
02:21:02,200 --> 02:21:04,000
We still gonna stop them now

1215
02:21:04,850 --> 02:21:05,610
I know

1216
02:21:07,100 --> 02:21:09,190
All right, I'm going to disarm the bomb,

1217
02:21:10,100 --> 02:21:11,301
you create a diversion

1218
02:21:11,301 --> 02:21:11,801
Okay

1219
02:21:11,801 --> 02:21:12,451
Okay?

1220
02:21:14,150 --> 02:21:14,900
Rachel?

1221
02:21:16,300 --> 02:21:17,390
Did I thank you?

1222
02:21:18,150 --> 02:21:19,110
No

1223
02:21:19,759 --> 02:21:20,980
I will

1224
02:21:34,700 --> 02:21:36,420
I could go this way, disarm the bomb,

1225
02:21:36,420 --> 02:21:37,980
you go that way

1226
02:21:39,950 --> 02:21:40,850
Okay?

1227
02:22:11,050 --> 02:22:12,330
Oh shit

1228
02:22:15,900 --> 02:22:16,630
Hi

1229
02:22:18,600 --> 02:22:19,870
Just...

1230
02:22:19,870 --> 02:22:21,261
...looking for the...

1231
02:22:21,750 --> 02:22:22,550
...ladies room

1232
02:22:29,200 --> 02:22:30,920
I tell you Gamush:

1233
02:22:31,650 --> 02:22:34,479
donkey fucking will become a sport

1234
02:22:34,600 --> 02:22:37,140
Babali, it will never become a sport

1235
02:22:37,140 --> 02:22:38,770
Who, in the right mind,

1236
02:22:38,770 --> 02:22:41,000
would pay good money
to see such a thing,

1237
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:43,950
when you know that horses are
so much more entertaining?

1238
02:22:43,950 --> 02:22:45,331
Horses aren't entertaining

1239
02:22:47,400 --> 02:22:48,999
[*door opens*]

1240
02:22:48,999 --> 02:22:50,269
[*chains and arabic jewelry sounds*]

1241
02:22:53,900 --> 02:22:55,070
This's never gonna work

1242
02:22:55,329 --> 02:22:56,339
Have some faith, man

1243
02:22:56,339 --> 02:22:57,089
Some faith?

1244
02:22:57,250 --> 02:22:59,200
How I became an agent
and run around in lady's underpants.

1245
02:22:59,200 --> 02:22:59,700
Shhh!

1246
02:23:00,200 --> 02:23:01,050
What do we have here?

1247
02:23:01,050 --> 02:23:03,720
I have two new concubines for His Highness

1248
02:23:04,800 --> 02:23:07,710
Ah... Very very nice

1249
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:11,590
I'm thinking I like this one

1250
02:23:11,590 --> 02:23:12,060
Uh

1251
02:23:12,060 --> 02:23:13,390
Strong like horse

1252
02:23:13,390 --> 02:23:15,410
How dare you touch Hussein's property?

1253
02:23:15,410 --> 02:23:18,340
He would cut your hand off
for showing such disrespect

1254
02:23:18,650 --> 02:23:21,460
Now step aside and let us through.

1255
02:23:22,200 --> 02:23:24,080
Thousand pardons, thousand pardons.

1256
02:23:24,080 --> 02:23:25,160
What were you thinking?

1257
02:23:26,160 --> 02:23:26,770
What we're...

1258
02:23:27,850 --> 02:23:29,850
Oh oh, that was for me?

1259
02:23:29,850 --> 02:23:31,450
For you? What are you talking about?

1260
02:23:31,450 --> 02:23:33,392
You look like every other guard here

1261
02:23:33,540 --> 02:23:34,750
I'm a very handsome man

1262
02:23:34,750 --> 02:23:36,040
I have a nice physique

1263
02:23:36,740 --> 02:23:38,550
Hmm, maybe you are right. Okay.

1264
02:23:38,550 --> 02:23:39,300
(I thank you Sir.)

1265
02:23:39,300 --> 02:23:41,309
- Let's go back to our post
- Okay

1266
02:23:42,150 --> 02:23:43,880
Who's my little Jihad?

1267
02:23:43,880 --> 02:23:45,470
Who is my little Jihad?

1268
02:23:45,470 --> 02:23:46,070
Come on

1269
02:23:46,220 --> 02:23:47,320
A kiss to Papa

1270
02:23:47,320 --> 02:23:48,430
Come on, don't be shy

1271
02:23:48,410 --> 02:23:49,130
There you go

1272
02:23:49,130 --> 02:23:50,850
Oh, would you talk cutie thing(?)

1273
02:23:51,100 --> 02:23:52,660
Hello, what's this?

1274
02:23:52,750 --> 02:23:55,340
I have brought two new wives for you

1275
02:23:56,131 --> 02:23:58,151
Ah... Two wives for me

1276
02:23:58,350 --> 02:23:59,790
Jade you shouldn't have

1277
02:23:59,790 --> 02:24:02,099
Is this in honor
of my birthday next week?

1278
02:24:04,650 --> 02:24:05,560
[*gunshots*]

1279
02:24:21,850 --> 02:24:22,600
Go

1280
02:24:23,900 --> 02:24:24,940
Wait for me

1281
02:25:05,541 --> 02:25:06,890
What took you so long?

1282
02:25:08,220 --> 02:25:09,930
Gather the girls
and meet me out front.

1283
02:25:11,150 --> 02:25:11,700
Okay

1284
02:25:13,700 --> 02:25:14,640
Now Watson.

1285
02:25:19,700 --> 02:25:21,040
Where did he go?
Come

1286
02:25:40,400 --> 02:25:41,430

I am mistress Stern

1296
02:27:42,550 --> 02:27:45,160
Well, hello to you sexy lady

1297
02:27:46,300 --> 02:27:47,640
Come to Jafar

1298
02:27:48,950 --> 02:27:49,680
Come on

1299
02:27:54,380 --> 02:27:56,010
[*strike of a whip*]
Move that out of my way

1300
02:27:57,150 --> 02:27:58,510
So...

1301
02:27:58,600 --> 02:28:00,670
You've been a bad boy, huh?

1302
02:28:00,699 --> 02:28:02,889
- You do not scare me
- Really?

1303
02:28:02,889 --> 02:28:04,100
- I am Jafar
- Really

1304
02:28:04,100 --> 02:28:05,000
[*sound of whip*]

1305
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:06,151
How about now?

1306
02:28:06,151 --> 02:28:07,201
Oh... maybe a little

1307
02:28:07,201 --> 02:28:08,961
- Little?
- Little

1308
02:28:10,350 --> 02:28:12,410
Oh... Are you gonna do
what I tell you to do?

1309
02:28:12,900 --> 02:28:13,490
Yes

1310
02:28:13,750 --> 02:28:15,910
I hope so, or I have to punish you

1311
02:28:17,930 --> 02:28:19,580
Let's see what we got here

1312
02:28:21,700 --> 02:28:23,290
Sounds like fun for me

1313
02:28:26,050 --> 02:28:26,730
Come here

1314
02:28:29,450 --> 02:28:30,560
Put your face in there

1315
02:28:36,950 --> 02:28:38,570
- You will fuck me good?
- Yes

1316
02:28:39,400 --> 02:28:40,310
I hope so

1317
02:28:40,310 --> 02:28:42,490
*** will be

1318
02:28:43,010 --> 02:28:45,570
But don't you start
by eating my pussy, huh?

1319
02:28:45,720 --> 02:28:47,240
Show me what you can do

1320
02:36:36,420 --> 02:36:39,368

1328
02:42:13,350 --> 02:42:14,510
What's going on in there?

1329
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:16,680
You asked for distraction

1330
02:42:17,200 --> 02:42:19,150
I'd say they're pretty
fucking distracted

1331
02:42:19,800 --> 02:42:21,870
Yeah, I'll give you that

1332
02:42:24,849 --> 02:42:27,349
So, I found the bomb. I defused it

1333
02:42:27,550 --> 02:42:29,990
And I found a room full of Jeeps,
so we get that hell out of here

1334

Let's go

1335

1336
02:42:58,700 --> 02:43:00,601
I left the bag here, I know I did.

1337

George...

1338
02:43:03,151 --> 02:43:04,772
Perhaps you're looking for this?

1339
02:43:04,772 --> 02:43:06,202
Oh no...

1340
02:43:06,923 --> 02:43:08,383

(George!)

1345
02:43:17,918 --> 02:43:20,700
Rachel, give me that… the vest, please.

1346
02:43:27,800 --> 02:43:29,180
My mother kicks harder than that

1347
02:43:29,180 --> 02:43:31,160
Oh does she? How about...

1348
02:43:32,850 --> 02:43:35,110
...down here,
let's see what we have over here.

1349
02:43:36,670 --> 02:43:38,019
Hello, missy.

1350
02:43:43,981 --> 02:43:44,891
George!

1351
02:43:50,450 --> 02:43:53,760
I'm sorry, but I don't think it's such
a good time for fishing my friend

1352
02:43:54,460 --> 02:43:55,390
You're not my friend

1353
02:44:13,400 --> 02:44:14,200
Oh my God

1354
02:44:14,200 --> 02:44:16,060
I told you these vests were cool.

1355
02:44:16,060 --> 02:44:17,150
Are you okay?

1356
02:44:17,150 --> 02:44:18,300
I'm okay. You okay?

1357
02:44:18,300 --> 02:44:19,010
Yeah, I'm okay

Ouch

1360
02:44:25,180 --> 02:44:27,380
You wouldn't shoot an unarmed
woman, won't you?

1361
02:44:29,500 --> 02:44:31,090
I would never do that

1362
02:44:32,300 --> 02:44:34,170
I only use my bare hands

1363
02:44:34,850 --> 02:44:36,440
so I can feel it

1364
02:44:45,051 --> 02:44:46,471

1368

It was the sexiest thing
I've ever seen

1369
02:45:27,200 --> 02:45:28,440
and scariest too

1370
02:45:29,110 --> 02:45:30,000
You okay?

1371
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:31,360
- Yeah. You okay?
- Yeah

02:45:36,330 --> 02:45:37,280
Yeah, me too

1374
02:45:37,280 --> 02:45:38,890
- I've time now.
- Me too.

1375
02:45:45,750 --> 02:45:46,580

Miss I gotta have you now

1388
02:46:09,930 --> 02:46:12,480
Wait, I thought you just disarmed
that thing

1389
02:46:12,480 --> 02:46:14,020
I did. I took the plutonium out

1390
02:46:14,101 --> 02:46:16,081
It will still launch, it just won't
detonate on impact

1391
02:46:16,861 --> 02:46:19,431
Well it's big enough to do some
serious fucking damage

1392
02:46:19,517 --> 02:46:21,330
and it's aimed right
to the White House

1393
02:46:21,330 --> 02:46:22,400
God damn it

1394
02:46:33,693 --> 02:46:35,200
Oh God

1395
02:46:36,167 --> 02:46:37,020
I know

1396
02:46:38,550 --> 02:46:41,220
You can't call it back now,
it's too late

1397
02:46:41,600 --> 02:46:43,600
No but I can change the coordinates

1398
02:46:48,050 --> 02:46:49,490
[*drifting skid sound*]

1399
02:47:02,500 --> 02:47:05,220
Please tell me that's gonna land
in the middle of the ocean

1400
02:47:06,200 --> 02:47:06,942
Nope.

1401
02:47:07,826 --> 02:47:08,584
Better

1402
02:47:19,600 --> 02:47:20,600
What's going on?

1403
02:47:22,050 --> 02:47:23,140
[*explosion*]

1404
02:47:24,500 --> 02:47:25,660

1405
02:47:25,850 --> 02:47:26,500
This way

1406
02:47:30,700 --> 02:47:34,191
I said "more head", not "warhead"

1407
02:47:35,100 --> 02:47:38,200
Oh boy... Come on Jihad

1408
02:47:38,650 --> 02:47:39,270
Come on!

1409
02:47:41,400 --> 02:47:42,290

1410
02:47:43,440 --> 02:47:45,140
Where am I gonna go?

1411
02:47:45,700 --> 02:47:46,360
Cuff him.

1412
02:47:46,360 --> 02:47:47,660
But he isn't going anyway, sir

1413
02:47:47,850 --> 02:47:49,100

This guy is mine

1418
02:47:59,420 --> 02:48:00,970
This guy belongs to a mutt?

The bounty hunter

1420
02:48:02,900 --> 02:48:04,080
Who the hell are you?

1421
02:48:04,120 --> 02:48:06,800
I told you:
I'm Mutt, the bounty hunter

1422
02:48:07,800 --> 02:48:08,610
Hell no

1423
02:48:10,400 --> 02:48:11,160
[*gunshots*]

1424
02:48:16,560 --> 02:48:17,120

1427
02:48:38,161 --> 02:48:39,511
Beautifully done darling.

1428
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:40,569
What's wrong?

1429
02:48:40,741 --> 02:48:41,800
You step on my foot

1430
02:48:41,800 --> 02:48:42,380
- Oh
- Ouch

1431
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:46,400
Congratulations on becoming
an agent, Rachel

1432
02:48:47,000 --> 02:48:48,430
I always knew you had it in you

1433
02:48:48,800 --> 02:48:51,350
Sir, we thought you were dead

1434
02:48:52,100 --> 02:48:52,920
Oh, non sense

1435
02:48:53,130 --> 02:48:55,240
Oh, it was very scary. Really

1436
02:48:55,700 --> 02:48:57,000
Then, without warning,

1437
02:48:57,000 --> 02:48:59,590
a coconut hits him
in the head out of nowhere

1438
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:03,380
He was unconscious for four days,

1439
02:49:03,380 --> 02:49:04,750
and when he came to,

1440
02:49:04,750 --> 02:49:06,800
he couldn't remember a thing

1441
02:49:07,150 --> 02:49:07,870
Aww...

1442
02:49:09,550 --> 02:49:11,590
I was so worried for him

1443
02:49:12,050 --> 02:49:14,090
A coconut, sir?

1444
02:49:18,100 --> 02:49:19,630
- Cheers
- Cheers

02:49:20,300 --> 02:49:22,760

1447
02:49:23,600 --> 02:49:24,680

02:49:28,200 --> 02:49:30,130
Hey, no hard feelings

1449
02:49:31,900 --> 02:49:32,620
Okay

You ready get out of here?

1454
02:49:42,950 --> 02:49:44,240
I thought you never asked

1455
02:49:52,000 --> 02:49:53,250
[*door closes*]

1456
02:49:59,400 --> 02:50:00,340
God!

1457
02:50:00,710 --> 02:50:01,980
