=======================

2
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:11,000
So romantic,

3
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,000
those glittering lights,

4
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:14,940
fill me with pride,

5
00:01:14,945 --> 00:01:18,500
my own, my beautiful, Riverside.

6
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,500
I wrote that

7
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,000
Yeah yeah, Riverside California

8
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,840
It's like so romantic

9
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,510
I hate this shit, you know that

10
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:31,300
Sometimes I think you have no poetry in your soul

11
00:01:31,301 --> 00:01:33,400
No poetry? Try this:

12
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:39,650
We sit for hours in this old truck no more near

13
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,500
We had an agreement darling

14
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:43,500
The wedding is only in a few short weeks

15
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,750
and then, I promise,

16
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:51,260
that I will take this swelling cock of yours

17
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,119
and grease it it with my tongue

18
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:56,539
and so you can slide real easy

19
00:01:57,319 --> 00:02:01,350
in my nice, warm, wet, hungry pussy

20
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:05,910
Do you have to make it any harder for me than it already is?

21
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,789
Don't do that anymore, please.

22
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:09,989
Poor dear

23
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,500
You need a nice handjob

24
00:02:12,501 --> 00:02:14,000
Yours of course

25
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,070
Is that any better there?

26
00:02:20,378 --> 00:02:21,500
What was that?

27
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,659
Do you need a hanky?

28
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,300
No, listen.

29
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,200
There's a clug

30
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:34,500
Do you feel that?

31
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:35,790
What is it?

32
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:41,160
He's taking my fucking aerial. 35 bucks

33
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,460
Motherfucker

34
00:02:49,309 --> 00:02:51,410
Well, need a light, missy?

35
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:52,670
Certainly sir

36
00:02:53,609 --> 00:02:55,070
Oh my god

37
00:02:58,410 --> 00:02:59,610
Oh, officer Blount

38
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,810
as I live and breathe

39
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:04,810
What are you doing in this park?

40
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:06,589
Checking up on morals

41
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:09,587
Seems like all these kids come up here

42
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:11,569
and think they can break every code of decency

43
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,500
Come on, you can tell me

44
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:19,090
Like feeling each other's...

45
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:22,559
Anything else?

46
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,590
Sucking each other's... should I tell you?

47
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,790
I just can't believe the immorality of some people

48
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:37,199
Yeah you could say that

49
00:03:44,528 --> 00:03:47,500
Yeah missy... Come on. That's it.

50
00:05:54,609 --> 00:05:57,830
Take care of gentlemen. Thank you miss.

51
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:22,330
Damn. I'll make you pay, you vandals.

52
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:25,830
My camera?

53
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,490
Holy ***

54
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:40,389
It's cheap aerial, really

55
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,989
Really I guess from chump or dope lights

56
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:47,730
Well, you're the champ. You know.

57
00:06:48,589 --> 00:06:51,560
He knows the best parking in town

58
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:57,510
Sounds like you've got a real head cold, sir 

59
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:02,530
I can offer you a cough candy?

60
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:08,980
A football player? a big seller like you

61
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,980
A big fellow like you

62
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:14,520
I sure would like your autograph

63
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,310
What about a picture instead?

64
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,500
Picture, yeah? Picture

65
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,500
Ok. Ok, ready?

66
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:37,000
Ok, keep the aerial. Take my car.

67
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:38,500
Take my fiancee

68
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:57,820
What were you doing honey?

69
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,029
I was getting lonely

70
00:08:00,129 --> 00:08:02,039
I hope it's true what they say

71
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,939
about absence making the heart grow fonder

72
00:08:05,139 --> 00:08:08,309
Let me show if it is? Okay?

73
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,009
Naughty boy

74
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:13,029
How kind of a girl do you think I am?

75
00:08:13,309 --> 00:08:15,449
Come on, let me just count the feel

76
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,500
- What is this?
- What?

77
00:08:18,549 --> 00:08:20,900
This. This repulsive thing.

78
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:04,400
Good gravy, what is it he want?

79
00:09:04,405 --> 00:09:06,200
I don't know, it sounds like he's in pain

80
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:38,600
*** paper now

81
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:05,400
Jesus Christ how is anyone expected to

82
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:06,520
be creative around here?

83
00:10:06,525 --> 00:10:10,400
- I'm sorry
- Just don't care of him, he's always kind of bad time

84
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:13,550
I'm Nora, you must be Chelsea new photographer

85
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:15,950
- For today. I don't keep jobs too long
- Oh

86
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,900
I dropped it

87
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:20,340
Well this is fine since you're very handsome

88
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:21,950
it's fine here

89
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:23,370
I've got it

90
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,200
That's it

91
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:32,000
Lunch with the Shah: 2460 dollars

92
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:32,700
plus tips

93
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:35,910
Big story?

94
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:40,510
Expensive report, takes dollars, fame, ***

95
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:43,900
Chah's been dead ten years, love

96
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,970
I really don't think the cop departments gonna go for this one

97
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,750
I knew that, sure

98
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,500
I had lunch with the Shah's spirit

99
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,600
He contacted me from beyond the grave

100
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,551
He's giving me fashion tips what Ronald

101
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,520
Reagan should wear to his next big dinner

102
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:04,430
Seem to forget who you're working for, Sweetheart

103
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,260
This is the National Expire

104
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:07,930
not the Washington Post

105
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,530
Good point, Dick.

106
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,500
If you don't get a real story

107
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:14,990
soon, for all going to be unemployed

108
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,500
I mean your records are so bad

109
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,550
we can't even get a job at the LA Times
- Yeah

110
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:26,500
- Oh, hello Mr. President
- Hi Holly, how are you?

111
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:30,490
(Thay all prentend talking on the phone)

112
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,420
(...so not why is President lives...)

113
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:35,350
(...yes well well no I'm on fire...)

114
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:39,319
(...okay yeah all right...)
(...okay...)

115
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:41,000
Hey boss!

116
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:43,500
Hi

117
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:46,269
- Holly North?
- Uh-huh

118
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:47,369
Fixed

119
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:52,769
- Miss Taylor?
- Miss Taylor

120
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,010
President Reagan.

121
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,010
Pathetic

122
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,500
This your idea of news?

123
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,480
What I want is a real story

124
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:14,500
"Barry Manilow was a man in his former life"

125
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,460
Not bad... But unbelievable!


126
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:20,500
Come on, people!

127
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:23,650
We need the big one here, the real story

128
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,510
Like...

129
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:27,010
Nah. No, not Bigfoot's boss

130
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:29,500
and we've been following that Big Putts angle

131
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,500
for four years now

132
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:34,270
it just doesn't go anywhere. It's nowhere.

133
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:36,680
I have to fire your ass you worm

134
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:41,040
You think I've been wrong about Big Putts

135
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,710
all along, huh, Mr. Journalism 101

136
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,920
you wouldn't know a story if it goosed you

137
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:48,589
Here. Look at that.

138
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:55,560
Wow, that's incredible

139
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:57,560
It's Big Putts

140
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,500
I've had it authenticated

141
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,960
I want all three of you to get up there to Hicksville

142
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:03,500
and get the real story

143
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,790
otherwise you can all go looking for

144
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,540
another job

145
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:09,310
Understand?

146
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,810
- Yes
- All of you

147
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:13,720
- Does he say tonight?
- Yes

148
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:17,320
Miss Mews come to my office please

149
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:21,250
***, take a chair

150
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:24,050
No thank you, I already have one like this

151
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,810
Quick. I like that from my employees

152
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:28,260
So very few had it.

153
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,260
Look, I want you to take down everything I say.

154
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:31,380
- Alright?
- Okay

155
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,510
- Ready?
- Ready

156
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,110
"Pants"

157
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,210
I caught you

158
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,500
"Pants"

159
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:43,700
Thank you

160
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,650
How long have you worked for us, Miss Mews?

161
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,220
- This is my first day
- Mm-hmm

162
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:50,670
Run into any arbitrary sex scenes yet?

163
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,110
I don't know. What's "arbitrary"?

164
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:55,600
"Arbitrary" means that we do it with no dramatic

165
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:57,360
reason except that the public expects it

166
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:092,500
Got it?

167
00:13:59,050 --> 00:13:59,500
Got what?

168
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,050
Don't they teach you anything at journalism school these days?

169
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:09,940
Um. I think it's all coming back to me

170
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,300
Listen girls... I...

171
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,500
Yeah, I think we've already been this way

172
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,300
You brought the compas, right Chelsea?

173
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,990
Oops. I think I dropped it

174
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:15,520
"Oops"? What do you mean "oops"?

175
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:16,380
Sorry

176
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:18,520
Great, forgot the ***

177
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,710
Lucky for you guys I think of everything

178
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,680
Bright, you brought a CB radio

179
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:30,500
No, something better. This.

180
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:54,330
One more time

181
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:10,500
I hate that damn tune

182
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:13,580
that's all you city slickers ever play

183
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:16,580
What is going on here?

184
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:19,969
Don't you know anything else?

185
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,410
I like Old MacDonald had a farm

186
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,290
I like the part where...

187
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:29,420

188
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:33,500
And in that farm he had some piggies

189
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:37,500
Can you squeal like a piggy, Sir?

190
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:39,100
I'll tell you all.

191
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:40,500
We got some friends waiting for us,

192
00:24:40,505 --> 00:24:41,850
so we should gonna be on the way, so...

193
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:42,950
That's so bad.

194
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,619
You girls,

195
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:46,399

196
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:47,390
What?

197
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:37,690
(...They're enforcing cold air down to the

198
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:39,450

(...p.m. we'll see the clouds burn off so

00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:51,550
(...you can go to the beach and your body right

204
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,500
(...down the hill tender tight spot...)

205
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:51,500
Oh good,

206
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:54,010

207
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:56,530

(...vessels right...)
Come on!

212
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:14,540
Ok, I know this isn't Mac, but

213
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:12,140
I won't *** a *** horse in the mouth

214
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:14,630
and you must be a horse

215
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:40,940
...Moo-moo here and moo-moo there

216
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,500
here a moo, there a moo

217
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,940
everywhere a moo moo

218
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,740
Old MacDonald had a farm

219
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,340
E-I-E-I-O

220
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,640
And on his farm he has some

221
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,240

222
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:54,240
Some what?

223
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:59,040
Come on, smarty pants city slickers,

224
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:00,800

225
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:03,500
- ... Old Mac Donald...?
- Dealers

226
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:07,000
And on his farm he had some dealers

227
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,500
E-I-E-I-O

228
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,600
With a...

229
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,100
What a hell sound does a dealer make?

230
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,400
Dealer... uh...

231
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,500
What would you say... Squeak-squeaker!

232
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,600
Squeak-squeaker

233
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,300
That's a damn mouse!

234
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,500
A faggot mouse!

235
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:26,340
You're a damn faggot boy?

236
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:28,340
Of course not!

237
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:32,240
That's too bad because I'm gonna have to kill you

238
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,500

00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,430
Come on.

247
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,730
(...Something...) He's tied.

248
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,330
Use all your womanly charms:

00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:56,330
Cocksucking, fucking, all of them

250
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:00,500

251
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:02,300
No

252
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,530
Nooo!

253
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,630
Don't do that so good

254
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:19,500
See:

255
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,000
They're not working on us

256
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:25,000
Let's clear the four dollar bill

257
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,500
I do dropped the notice anyway

258
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:07,300
Looks like you ***, boy

259
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,900
If you don't sing the Donalds farm

260
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,000
with the damn ***

261
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,300
I just got no use for you

262
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,490
Hey, I think he's hurt

263
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:33,450
Get me out of these ropes

264
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,000
so I'll finish this fucker off

265
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:35,700
Really

266
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,900
It's a clap of an arrow

267
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,550
No, it's a car aerial antenna

268
00:40:43,555 --> 00:40:45,200
with feather state to it

269
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,000
(*Roar*)

270
00:40:47,055 --> 00:40:47,500
Shit!

271
00:40:49,505 --> 00:40:50,800
*** Big Putts

272
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,550
Well, say you say Beulah honey?

273
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,340
I said are you sure this how they have interviews

274
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:10,430
in the big city?

275
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:11,930
I mean it's sure hard to talk

276
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:13,500
I know it must be hard

277
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:15,300
But you can ease up for a little while

278
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:16,360
Now,

279
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:19,200
Tell me again how you saw Big Putts at the outhouse

280
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,260
Well, it's pretty disgusting

281
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:25,500
Oh no much like this

282
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,450
He'll have my ass in a sling

283
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,500
Boss what are you doing here?

284
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:36,770
Your job is what I'm doing. You might

285
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,060
think my days are over as a reporter, but

286
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:40,820
I could still kick your ass when it

287
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:42,680
comes to a story. This fine lady has just

288
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:46,060
given me an exclusive: she's actually

289
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:45,000
seen Big Putts in action

290
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:46,000
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah

291
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,930
Yeah, well, let's have this for a headline:

292
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:52,019
National expiry reporter target Big Putts

293
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:53,610
his anger brush with death

294
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:55,010
I nearly ate it this time he says

295
00:41:56,409 --> 00:41:58,040
Go on. Hotshot.

296
00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:01,030
Oh the old man crumpled his arrow found his

297
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:06,109
mark was a tragic end to a man they call

298
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:07,910
Big Mac the much-loved banjo player who

299
00:42:06,109 --> 00:42:08,460
knew every verse of Old MacDonald for memory

300
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:09,779
I hate the second.

301
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:12,379
Where does Big Putts coming all of this?

302
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,930
It sounds like my old Mac but it can't be

303
00:42:14,979 --> 00:42:17,360
he never knew every verse of Old MacDonald

304
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:19,960
I want you to take me to the scene of the crime

305
00:42:19,965 --> 00:42:23,079
First, you will go for my clothes right back

306
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,580
There you do the...

307
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:31,880
- That hello interview?
- Yeah

308
00:42:28,369 --> 00:42:29,019
Sort of.

309
00:42:30,509 --> 00:42:31,719
I've come you know any closer

310
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,779
Wow, nice essay

is thought to be the only genuine aphrodisiac

313
00:42:51,779 --> 00:42:54,420
they tend to make even the most frigid women

314
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:55,590
sexually ravenous

315
00:42:57,430 --> 00:42:58,560
Isn't that something?

Oh don't get any ideas here

00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:28,550
How about a toast to married life

00:44:37,870 --> 00:44:39,010

Drink, drink, drink up

Is anybody home?

335
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:28,530
*** to fall for this routine

336
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:31,030

337
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:35,530
So exhausted

338
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:49,530

340
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:59,130
Time to find pet: Meenie Miney and Mo

I love your tongue

349
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:40,350
It's rude to talk with a survival knife in your mouth

350
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:42,200
I'm sorry

351
00:59:42,350 --> 00:59:43,850

00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:56,100
"Excusez-moi"

357
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:58,550
I knew I knew I know, don't say it

I don't seem as mature as I look

359
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:04,424
Everybody says it and it makes me sick

361
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:07,655

01:00:16,290 --> 01:00:17,332
What are you doing out here?

367
01:00:17,350 --> 01:00:20,824
Such a long story...

01:00:33,950 --> 01:00:35,216
and an arrow came out of a tree

373
01:00:35,217 --> 01:00:36,526
and *** forward

374
01:00:36,527 --> 01:00:38,098
How *** ?

375
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:40,237
My god...

376
01:00:43,611 --> 01:00:45,132
Better get him to the authorities

377
01:00:45,133 --> 01:00:47,720
Hope the killer had his *** made up properly

378
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:50,199
I mean I don't even know if it was perfect season anyway

379
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:54,362
Arg.... Hee-ya hee-ya oh

380
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:56,940
Not dead yet. He's still alive!

381
01:00:56,940 --> 01:00:58,000
(...and in his farm he has ...)

382
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:02,840
Oh look at this!

383
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:03,561
- What?
- Arrow went right through his bottle

384
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:05,039
Saved his life

385
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:09,811
When he'll finds out his bottle's been punctured that will kill him for sure

386
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:13,358
What the fuck was that?

387
01:01:13,358 --> 01:01:15,993
It was Big Putts, there is no doubt

388
01:01:17,430 --> 01:01:22,220
...with quack quack here and a quack quack there...

389
01:01:25,290 --> 01:01:27,007
Again, good.

390
01:01:31,890 --> 01:01:37,279
So I knew I had to project to develop this tremendous roar

391
01:01:36,490 --> 01:01:39,968
all that theater playing it was very worthwhile

392
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,233
I guess you could call me the original screaming...

393
01:01:43,233 --> 01:01:45,277
But why did you shoot that man back there?

394
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:46,540
Need to ask?

395
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:50,296
He was singing Old MacDonald had a farm

396
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:53,920
I mean why not? What a rare mood I mean

397
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:56,710
or comes to the cavalry old chum

398
01:01:56,710 --> 01:02:00,684
"Old MacDonald had a farm", this should be a hanging crime

399
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:02,320
But you took the law into your own hands

400
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:04,502
judge Wapner would be *** of that

401
01:02:04,502 --> 01:02:09,400
Sometimes you have to rise above the lord to do the right thing

402
01:02:09,430 --> 01:02:11,632
*** top of that

403
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:15,490
I think I know what your problem is

404
01:02:15,490 --> 01:02:20,138
I'm sorry Missy but women are not my cup of tea

405
01:02:20,150 --> 01:02:21,686
Who's talking about tea?

406
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:24,735
I'm talking about sex

407
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:45,856
Who are you?

408
01:02:45,860 --> 01:02:48,064
I'm your fairy godmother

409
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:52,000
Oh good. Fuck me fairy godmother

410
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:54,186
Who is it dear?

411
01:02:54,190 --> 01:02:56,402
It's just fairy godmother

412
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:00,860
Fuck me, fairy godmother

413
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:02,654
Hold *** this time, okay?

414
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:46,180
Oh...

415
01:12:51,289 --> 01:12:54,221
They must be healthier in the ***

416
01:12:57,400 --> 01:12:59,190
I'm really sorry it happened honey

417
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:01,200
Well, I suppose every girl has to lose

418
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:03,350
her virginity at some time

419
01:13:03,715 --> 01:13:06,230
I'm just glad it was with you

420
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:12,626
Goodbye fairy godmother

421
01:13:12,627 --> 01:13:13,739
And Thank you

422
01:13:13,740 --> 01:13:15,101
Okay

423
01:13:20,530 --> 01:13:24,200
God, I've got find out Chelsea

424
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:30,358
Boy I need a drink

425
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:32,466
So what else is new?

426
01:13:33,490 --> 01:13:35,835
All this chasing around in the woods

427
01:13:35,870 --> 01:13:38,278
I'm tired. I get too old for it

428
01:13:38,420 --> 01:13:40,794
*** I wonder have we changed

429
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:42,855
And not like Vinnie

430
01:13:43,085 --> 01:13:45,240
He's on the Big Putts trail right now

431
01:13:45,245 --> 01:13:47,100
Just like a cub reporter

432
01:13:47,700 --> 01:13:49,200
Yeah, but he's got what it takes

433
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:51,000
to be a good newspaper reporter

434
01:13:51,010 --> 01:13:55,532
He's got energy, and maturity, and

435
01:13:56,410 --> 01:13:57,967
a whole warped mind

436
01:13:59,410 --> 01:14:01,039
There's something different about you

437
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:05,723
Well maybe it's because I don't have half my clothes on

438
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:07,710
Huh. No, no, that's huh

439
01:14:07,710 --> 01:14:10,405
That's different. You have a glow

440
01:14:11,590 --> 01:14:12,536
Is it huh...

441
01:14:12,660 --> 01:14:14,410
Is that *** I've been fucked

442
01:14:14,410 --> 01:14:16,168
until my ears *** ?

443
01:14:18,065 --> 01:14:19,456
Sounds good though

444
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:23,320
I don't suppose you'd consider

445
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:25,562
something serious sex

446
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:30,760
I like men *** nice and straight ***

447
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:01,840

448
01:17:33,030 --> 01:17:34,183
On my tits

449
01:17:51,683 --> 01:17:52,139
Who do that?

450
01:17:52,139 --> 01:17:54,818
Hate to admit it but I did

451
01:17:54,819 --> 01:17:56,513
Maybe the roar is the Big Putts'

452
01:17:57,960 --> 01:18:00,327
Better go out of here

453
01:18:06,850 --> 01:18:08,884
This is yours, that's mine

454
01:18:13,709 --> 01:18:15,479
- Hic!
- Excuse me?

455
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:16,660
No, this is his name

456
01:18:16,660 --> 01:18:19,097
Mac Hic is the musical pervert

457
01:18:19,180 --> 01:18:22,164
And you know what I want from you, boy 

458
01:18:22,335 --> 01:18:27,490
You won't get it

459
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:27,490
Now then what if I *** your girlfriend here?

460
01:18:27,490 --> 01:18:29,424
What do you want from him?

461
01:18:29,450 --> 01:18:32,988
He wants me to sing Old MacDonald and I won't do it

462
01:18:32,988 --> 01:18:35,993
I truly ***, stand up yourself, Flambo

463
01:18:35,993 --> 01:18:36,997
Get the *** away

464
01:18:37,810 --> 01:18:40,751
And on his farm he had some cows

465
01:18:40,751 --> 01:18:43,030
Hee-ya hee-ya oh.

466
01:18:43,030 --> 01:18:46,177
With a moo-moo here, and a moo-moo there,

467
01:18:46,178 --> 01:18:49,245
Here a moo, there a moo, everywhere a moo...

468
01:18:50,405 --> 01:18:54,019
Big Putts...!

469
01:18:55,749 --> 01:18:58,942
I hear sound that a Big Putts make

470
01:19:00,690 --> 01:19:02,242
It was alive

471
01:19:13,089 --> 01:19:15,720
I never forget a face

472
01:19:15,720 --> 01:19:17,936
Hey journalism has to rise above the facts

473
01:19:17,939 --> 01:19:20,340
and fill ***
