00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,790
He come on.  What's for dinner?

3
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:42,290
Who's hungry?  I'm hungry.

4
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,250
Couple sandwiches.

5
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,500
Yeah, CW's got a brand new special.

6
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,460
He and his passengers were 2 highway patrolmen...

7
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:17,660
...and a blind stenographer.  How's that?

8
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,060
That's great.  That's great.

9
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:39,740
Look at what we got here.

10
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,650
Don't even move a muscle.

11
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:45,150
Interrupting your little picnic, huh?

12
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:50,270
Say Marshall!

13
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:56,100
I ain't never seen shooting like that, Clide.

14
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:56,850
Yeah.

15
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,260
Good shot!

16
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:01,760
What do we got here?  Huh?

17
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,250
We ain't going nowhere.

18
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,970
Get his cuffs!

19
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:08,400
You ain't getting away with this!

20
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,790
You gonna pay for this!

21
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,970
What's going on here?

22
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:17,470
What you gonna do?  Huh?

23
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,970
Find out exactly what you're doing here.

24
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:24,320
This is Missouri.  What are you doing here?

25
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,820
I know.

26
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:30,570
You heard about the reward on the Barrow gang, right?

27
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:33,770
You heard about the reward.  You think it's OK?

28
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:35,640
You think you can come down here...

29
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,140
...pick yourself a mighty fine reward.  I can tell you, it ain't gonna happen.

30
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,250
Shoot him.  Shoot him.

31
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,940
You ain't gonna get away with it.

32
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:47,060
You know where you are?

33
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:51,090
It's Missouri.  You ain't got no laws around here.

34
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:52,540
We got the pretty girls.

35
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,510
They got the guns.  We got the guns.

36
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:57,000
We got the cars and we got a mind...

37
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,870
...to show you...

38
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:03,560
...that we ain't takin' it no more.

39
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,320
Don't do it.

40
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:10,400
Before I blow your brains into the next county, I want you to tell me something.

41
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,900
I want you to tell all us something.

42
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,890
Why you after us?

43
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:20,390
There's all them poor people out there you should be protecting.

44
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:23,100
Ain't enough people in Texas for you to look after...

45
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:26,600
...you got to come all the way across how many state lines?

46
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,100
Looking for us?

47
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:35,680
So what are we gonna do with him?

48
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,150
I got an idea.

49
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,090
What do you think Bonnie?

50
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:43,280
Well, I think we should take a few pictures of him...

51
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,780
...send them to the papers.  Show 'em how friendly we all are.

52
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:49,690
Woo hoo!  Sounds like an idea to me.

53
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:53,190
I got your camera right here.

54
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,890
There you go.

55
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:57,800
We're gonna get friendly.

56
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,300
His hair. His hat. His big gun.

57
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:07,660
Come on you gonna be a star!

58
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:10,310
Yoo hoo!  OK.

59
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:13,810
I got ya'.  Smile everybody.

60
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:19,540
Now can we kill him?

61
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:23,740
Now come on.  Look.

62
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:27,240
We're being all nice and friendly now.

63
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,740
OK?  So that's the Barrow gang.  That's how we are.

64
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:36,300
I say, we came out in this beautiful sunshine...

65
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,800
...with our beautiful gals for a picnic.

66
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,760
And a party.

67
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,200
We had a picnic, so...

68
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:48,560
Let's have a party!  Woo hoo!  Let's do it!

69
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,350
Get me out of these handcuffs!

70
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:16,190
Ha ha!  That's it.  That's the long arm of the law.

71
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,540
Come here.

72
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:06,770
These are mighty tight.

73
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,630
Are you gonna make me come?

74
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:49,130
Are you gonna make me come?  Come all over here.

75
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:51,070
That's a great ride, baby!  Oh yeah!

76
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:56,840
Throw him in the lake?  You up for that?  Sure.

77
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:01,750
I swear to god, you ain't seen the last of me!

78
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:18,670
Hey!  It's a turkey shoot!

79
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:22,280
Show what you got!

80
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:31,890
Do you hear something?  I can't hear nothing.

81
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:35,270
You ain't seen the last of me, Bonnie and Clide!

82
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:54,780
Can we help you with something?  Ummm.

83
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:57,460
Perhaps do you wanna get it on?

84
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:00,700
Uhh....the dress.

85
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,420
Oh.  Do you wanna see what it looks like?

86
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,970
I dunno.  Do you  think it's me?

87
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:08,150
Oh, I think it's totally you.

88
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:11,650
OK.

89
00:28:57,370 --> 00:28:59,010
Oh my god!  Is that a gun?

90
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:02,510
Well, yeah.

91
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:04,610
Is it loaded?

92
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:07,220
It might be.  Do you wanna touch it?

93
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,220
Yeah.

94
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,390
What's your name?

95
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:12,090
My name...is Bonnie Parker.

96
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:14,270
What do you do?

97
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:16,730
Um...nothing.

98
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:18,820
Why do you have a gun?

99
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:21,980
I just, you know, like to keep myself safe.

100
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:25,480
Can I hold it?  There's like all sorts of perverts around.

101
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:28,980
You can touch it all you like.

102
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:33,670
You guys are like....You're so hot!

103
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:37,780
I wanna see more!  You get that off!

104
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:43,420
You gonna help me.  I'll help you.

105
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:28,450
You like that.  Keep teasing me like that.

106
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:43,410
Hey y'all!  Wow.

107
00:54:43,410 --> 00:54:46,910
Now.

108
00:54:46,910 --> 00:54:50,690
I guess you heard about the Barrow gang?

109
00:54:58,220 --> 00:55:00,630
Well that's us!

110
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:05,170
Aw, come on now.  Don't be scared.  Gather round.

111
00:55:05,170 --> 00:55:10,390
We ain't gonna steal from you.  You ain't got nothin'.

112
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:14,530
Look.  I'm Clide Barrow.

113
00:55:14,530 --> 00:55:17,570
And this here... I'm Miss Bonnie Parker.

114
00:55:17,570 --> 00:55:21,070
You heard of the Barrow Gang, right.  Yeah.

115
00:55:21,070 --> 00:55:23,800
You know what you don't here of?

116
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:26,780
You don't hear from them laws.

117
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:30,280
About we here...shootin' our guns...

118
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:33,160
...and runnin' away in our automobiles...

119
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:36,660
...to give you money.

120
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:40,470
This is for you guys.  Come on.  Take it.

121
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:45,220
Take it.  That's right.

122
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:49,190
Cause we got a mountain of it!

123
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:57,870
That's all for y'all.

124
00:55:57,870 --> 00:56:02,000
You ain't gonna be poor no more.  Not with the Barrow Gang.

125
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:07,030
And see what else we got for ya.

126
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:12,720
Miss Bonnie picked these out herself, right?

127
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:16,220
Look at that.

128
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:29,030
Now listen y'all, listen one second, OK?

129
00:56:29,030 --> 00:56:32,220
We ain't here to do you no violence.

130
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:34,700
We're here to be part of you.

131
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:38,200
Because without you we ain't got no country.

132
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:41,850
When the laws come round that mountaintop...

133
00:56:41,850 --> 00:56:44,640
...and they're surely gonna come.  You know that.

134
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:48,140
When the laws come round and they say...

135
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:52,050
You seen Bonnie and Clide?  You seen Bonnie and Clide?

136
00:56:52,050 --> 00:56:55,990
You can tell 'em you seen us.  You can tell 'em you seen Bonnie and Clide.

137
00:56:55,990 --> 00:56:59,010
You tell those suckers you seen us...

138
00:56:59,010 --> 00:57:01,660
...and what we done here.

139
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:06,630
Just tell 'em we headed in that direction to Oklahoma, OK?

140
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:10,130
That all right?  You do that for us?

141
00:57:10,130 --> 00:57:12,910
We want you to have a party, OK?

142
00:57:12,910 --> 00:57:18,310
We want you to have a fine party.  Dress that goat.  But first...

143
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:22,710
I just want you to hear some words from my beautiful Bonnie.

144
00:57:22,710 --> 00:57:26,210
Who wrote something for you guys.

145
00:57:26,210 --> 00:57:29,710
You're gonna remember a long time.

146
00:57:29,710 --> 00:57:34,100
Now I got it here for you honey, somewhere.

147
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:38,340
Now this here...

148
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:41,620
Was written by Miss Bonnie Parker, herself...

149
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:45,670
For you.  This here is a ballad...

150
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:49,170
...of Bonnie and Clide.

151
00:57:49,170 --> 00:57:50,720
Listen up.

152
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:53,900
We each of us have a good alibi...

153
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:59,130
...for being down here in the joint.  But few of them are really justified.

154
00:57:59,130 --> 00:58:01,940
...if you get right down to the point.

155
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:04,870
Now Bonnie and Clide are the Barrow Gang...

156
00:58:04,870 --> 00:58:08,200
I'm sure how you all read how the rob and steal...

157
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:13,680
And those who squeal are found dying and dead.

158
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:16,750
There's lots of untruths to these write ups...

159
00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:19,330
They're not so ruthless as that.

160
00:58:19,330 --> 00:58:22,520
Their nature is raw.  They hate all law...

161
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:25,190
...stool pigeons and rats.

162
00:58:25,190 --> 00:58:27,910
They call them cold-blooded killers...

163
00:58:27,910 --> 00:58:30,490
...they say they're heartless and mean.

164
00:58:30,490 --> 00:58:33,990
But I say with pride, I once knew Cllide...

165
00:58:33,990 --> 00:58:37,490
...when he was honest, upright, and clean.

166
00:58:37,490 --> 00:58:40,990
From heartbreak some people have suffered.

167
00:58:40,990 --> 00:58:43,940
From weariness some people have died.

168
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:46,990
But all in all, our troubles are small...

169
00:58:46,990 --> 00:58:49,680
...till we get like Bonnie and Clide.

170
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:52,100
If a policeman is killed in Dallas...

171
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:54,530
...and they have no clue or guide...

172
00:58:54,530 --> 00:58:58,050
If they can't find a fiend, just wipe the slate clean...

173
00:58:58,050 --> 00:59:00,820
...and hang it on Bonnie and Clide.

174
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:05,390
If they try to act like citizens, and rent a nice flat...

175
00:59:05,390 --> 00:59:08,270
About the third night, they're invited to fight..

176
00:59:08,270 --> 00:59:11,220
...by a sub guns, "Rat Tat Tat".

177
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:13,870
They don't think they're tough or desperate.

178
00:59:13,870 --> 00:59:16,590
They know the law always wins.

179
00:59:16,590 --> 00:59:20,360
They've been shot at before, they do not ignore...

180
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:23,150
That death is the wages of sin.

181
00:59:23,150 --> 00:59:25,750
Some day they'll go down together...

182
00:59:25,750 --> 00:59:28,470
And they'll bury them side by side.

183
00:59:28,470 --> 00:59:31,970
To few it'll be grief, to the law a relief.

184
00:59:31,970 --> 00:59:35,470
But it's death for Bonnie and Clide!

185
00:59:41,410 --> 00:59:45,750
Now y'all go have a party!  Yeah!

186
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:50,600
Hey, you poor people.

187
01:02:56,120 --> 01:03:01,970
Miss Bonnie is giving her verses?

188
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:23,050
Would you like to fuck my ass again?  Well fuck me then.

189
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:29,210
Would you like to fuck me?

190
01:09:38,630 --> 01:09:40,620
I've got my ass wide open for you.

191
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:34,750
Alright gentlemen, listen up.

192
01:17:34,750 --> 01:17:38,940
These Thompson guns are capable of firing 180 rounds per minute.

193
01:17:38,940 --> 01:17:40,440
OK.

194
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:42,990
Shred a man to pieces.  Know what I'm saying.

195
01:17:42,990 --> 01:17:45,000
Knock him clean down.

196
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:50,390
However, we're not going to use force to take down Bonnie and Clide.

197
01:17:50,390 --> 01:17:54,900
We're gonna use stealth.

198
01:18:00,090 --> 01:18:02,180
Who the hell are they?

199
01:18:05,100 --> 01:18:08,390
Gentlemen, I call them Honeytraps.

200
01:18:08,390 --> 01:18:11,890
Couple of sleazy broads gonna bring down Clide Barrow?

201
01:18:11,890 --> 01:18:15,390
Gentlemen I assure you they can do more than fuck.

202
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:28,280
How much do they charge an hour?

203
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:32,500
More than you sugar.  Wanna see why?

204
01:39:10,100 --> 01:39:11,720
Well, hello.

205
01:39:11,720 --> 01:39:13,180
How you doing sweet thing?

206
01:39:13,180 --> 01:39:14,500
I'm good how are you?

207
01:39:14,500 --> 01:39:15,520
What ya' doing?

208
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:16,890
Just walking.

209
01:39:16,890 --> 01:39:19,220
Uh huh.  Where to?

210
01:39:19,220 --> 01:39:21,120
Well that all just depends.

211
01:39:21,120 --> 01:39:22,940
On what?

212
01:39:22,940 --> 01:39:25,260
Well where are you going?

213
01:39:25,260 --> 01:39:30,650
Well here, me and my lady are just about deciding.

214
01:39:30,650 --> 01:39:34,950
Thinkin' about finding some honeysuckle down in that wood.

215
01:39:34,950 --> 01:39:38,980
Well their in bloom this time of year so you'll have some.

216
01:39:39,390 --> 01:39:42,480
Absolutely.

217
01:39:49,940 --> 01:39:51,850
Come and join the show.

218
01:39:51,850 --> 01:39:53,970
I'll be you director.

219
01:39:53,970 --> 01:39:57,470
It's a romance.  Yeah.  Now.

220
01:39:57,470 --> 01:40:00,970
I've got to make me like one of them Hollywood directors.

221
01:40:03,830 --> 01:40:07,300
Ain't never seen a film like that at the gold mine.

222
01:40:08,750 --> 01:40:10,620
You're so not shy!

223
01:40:11,500 --> 01:40:12,930
We really aren't around here.

224
01:40:12,930 --> 01:40:14,980
Let's get these off.

225
01:40:17,320 --> 01:40:20,850
Take that honeysuckle!

226
01:40:21,830 --> 01:40:23,890
Let me give you a hand.

227
01:40:23,890 --> 01:40:25,730
Thank you!

228
01:40:25,730 --> 01:40:28,060
Oh.  Such a gentleman.

229
01:40:29,550 --> 01:40:32,810
Oh, she definitely ain't got no concealed weapons in there!

230
01:40:32,810 --> 01:40:35,250
I don't think so, but I might be hiding something else.

231
01:40:39,070 --> 01:40:41,430
You know what?  Let's get these dresses.

232
01:40:47,980 --> 01:40:50,120
Have a seat.

233
01:40:51,100 --> 01:40:53,620
It's like a picnic.

234
01:41:13,750 --> 01:41:15,430
You taste just like honey

235
01:41:16,600 --> 01:41:18,930
And you're suckling, huh?

236
01:42:19,230 --> 01:42:22,220
Yee ha!

237
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:25,480
That's ridin'!

238
01:42:31,990 --> 01:42:34,540
You like that girlie!  Uh huh!

239
01:43:39,030 --> 01:43:43,080
Do you like that?  See how much!

240
01:43:50,230 --> 01:43:53,230
Put some honeysuckle right on that!

241
01:44:56,490 --> 01:44:59,560
Who wants to come have a ride on good old Clide?

242
01:45:03,240 --> 01:45:04,770
Who's first?

243
01:45:06,110 --> 01:45:08,620
Miss Parker, I surely declare.

244
01:45:08,620 --> 01:45:11,130
She's always first on the buggie.

245
01:46:59,910 --> 01:47:01,730
Shall we take a looksee at that?

246
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:10,740
What a pretty place!

247
01:47:22,150 --> 01:47:23,360
Lookee what I got.

248
01:47:23,360 --> 01:47:26,170
Anybody want these?  Anybody want these?

249
01:47:28,280 --> 01:47:30,940
Ain't that a mighty shame?

250
01:47:38,310 --> 01:47:39,740
I can't go home without my knickers!

251
01:47:39,740 --> 01:47:43,240
You surely can't.

252
01:50:44,930 --> 01:50:49,490
How 'bout I give you a river view?  A river view?

253
01:50:51,190 --> 01:50:54,100
If I slip y'all coming down with me.

254
01:50:54,100 --> 01:50:57,600
My knickers are all ready down there.

255
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:35,120
If this isn't a girl's dream?

256
01:51:52,400 --> 01:51:54,590
You wanna go?  You jealous?

257
01:51:54,590 --> 01:51:55,120
Yes.

258
01:52:01,400 --> 01:52:03,780
You come be my sunshine.

259
01:52:41,540 --> 01:52:43,150
You look so good!

260
01:53:14,100 --> 01:53:16,510
All right Clide, get her.

261
01:54:51,030 --> 01:54:54,000
There you go.  Big Ben baby.

262
01:55:42,630 --> 01:55:48,930
Nice to be at a little stop in the country!

263
01:55:56,530 --> 01:55:58,650
That was delicious!

264
01:55:59,700 --> 01:56:03,030
Hey, a little bit more honey for you baby!

265
01:56:10,440 --> 01:56:18,320
What's going to be round the next corner?

266
01:56:18,320 --> 01:56:21,950
Look, I gots me an idea OK?

267
01:56:21,950 --> 01:56:23,830
What we gonna do...

268
01:56:23,830 --> 01:56:27,800
...gonna get ourselves a nice little house.

269
01:56:27,800 --> 01:56:31,300
On the other side of the state line, right?  Yeah.

270
01:56:31,300 --> 01:56:34,060
And then, all the robbin' we doin'...

271
01:56:34,060 --> 01:56:36,310
...we do it the other side of the state line.

272
01:56:36,310 --> 01:56:39,110
The laws ain't never gonna catch us, right?

273
01:56:39,110 --> 01:56:43,830
And you're gonna have you're own little garden...your place.

274
01:56:43,830 --> 01:56:45,180
And we goin' a be safe.

275
01:56:45,180 --> 01:56:46,070
Yeah.

276
01:56:46,070 --> 01:56:49,570
Cause look, you know, we ain't doing this just for us.

277
01:56:49,570 --> 01:56:53,070
We ain't doin' it just for the money.

278
01:56:53,070 --> 01:56:54,670
Not about the gettin' anything.

279
01:56:54,670 --> 01:56:59,890
It's about the getting away from everything.

280
01:56:59,890 --> 01:57:02,020
Bein' free.

281
01:57:02,020 --> 01:57:04,770
Let's go be free then.

282
01:57:04,770 --> 01:57:08,270
Let's get away.  Let's go.

283
01:57:08,270 --> 01:57:09,950
Come on!

284
01:57:09,950 --> 01:57:11,790
I'm driving!

285
01:57:11,790 --> 01:57:13,770
Oh no!  Oh yeah!

286
01:57:54,500 --> 01:57:55,960
Can I be of assistance?

287
01:57:55,960 --> 01:57:57,960
Yeah, uh, sir.

288
01:57:57,960 --> 01:57:59,780
You think you can help me and my friend out?

289
01:57:59,780 --> 01:58:02,310
Oh surely.  What's the matter?

290
01:58:02,310 --> 01:58:06,110
I don't know.  Some engine trouble.

291
01:58:06,110 --> 01:58:08,100
We also ran into this tree.

292
01:58:08,100 --> 01:58:11,600
Oh my. Well...

293
01:58:11,600 --> 01:58:17,850
Oh yeah, you surely got problems with your axle.

294
01:58:20,640 --> 01:58:23,590
Yeah, look....

295
01:58:23,590 --> 01:58:27,090
I ain't got much in the way of tools back there.

296
01:58:27,950 --> 01:58:30,590
But you know what?

297
01:58:30,590 --> 01:58:34,090
I got me a pile of dollar bills.

298
01:58:35,560 --> 01:58:38,740
Why don't I go see what I can figure out.

299
01:58:40,250 --> 01:58:42,240
OK.  Anything helps.

300
01:59:58,720 --> 02:00:03,140
And that is the story of Bonnie and Clide.
