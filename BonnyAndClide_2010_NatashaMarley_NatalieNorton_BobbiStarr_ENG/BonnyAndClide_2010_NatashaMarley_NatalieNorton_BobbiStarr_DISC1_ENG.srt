00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:27,990
Clide, will I ever see you again?

3
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,180
Why sure honey.

4
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:34,850
Soon as this here bag is all filled up with money.

5
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:36,420
But for now...

6
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,420
I gotta go.  Thanks everybody.

7
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:42,160
You've just been robbed by Clide Barrow, OK?

8
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,160
Good day to y'all.

9
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,120
I want a divorce!

10
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,090
What the hell is this?

11
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:52,970
Uhm, I'm sorry sir.  It's not your day.

12
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:54,970
Oh, not any day.

13
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:58,680
There's not been more than $100 in this place since the crash.

14
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,680
Just come on over here, honey.

15
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,740
Right on behind here.

16
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:09,960
Now.  Not that I don't believe you or nothin', but...

17
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,079
How's about we take a looksee in there?  Huh?

18
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,970
God!

19
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,970
Damnit.  Told ya.

20
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:24,060
Hey, you don't need money anyway!

21
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,860
I'm just trying to break up the boredom in this shabby hotel.

22
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,540
We're 2 hard working girls.

23
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,260
Trying to earn a little extra green.

24
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,890
Maybe we can help you pass some time?

25
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:42,600
Why?  You think I need to pay for it?

26
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,110
You not man enough for the 2 of us?

27
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:47,110
We won't be paid for it.

28
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:51,470
Matter of fact, we won't even care that you are just one.

29
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,260
So, first thing...

30
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,540
...let's make sure we're not going to be disturbed.

31
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,090
Let's find out.

32
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,160
Let's see what you got.

33
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,070
That's pretty.

34
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,460
I'd say that's getting you $1/minute.  No overtime.

35
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,450
I gotta say.  That was a pretty nice...

36
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:12,200
...run on the bank.

37
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,220
But you know what?

38
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:17,660
If you want to make...

39
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:21,190
...more of this silly green stuff...

40
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:23,870
Theres just one thing you gotta do for me

41
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:25,380
What?

42
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:30,650
Next time this place is all full up.

43
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:37,980
You just let me know.  We gotta deal?

44
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:42,890
Uh huh?  We gotta deal?  We gotta deal.

45
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:45,510
In the meantime I guess.

46
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:48,890
That's all yours.

47
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:52,150
Now, I gotta fly.

48
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:55,910
I'm going to divide my heart like this dollar...

49
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:58,870
...between you.

50
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:02,220
I gotta hit the road.

51
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:10,080
Remember to tell 'em.  You just been stuck up by Clide Barrow, hisself.

52
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:15,390
Be sure to.

53
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:55,120
Damnit.

54
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:05,730
What in heavens is wrong with you now?

55
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:07,730
God!  Damnit.

56
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:12,120
Damn car!

57
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:23,040
Oh!  God!

58
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:17,050
Hey!

59
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:20,120
You trying to steal my momma's car?

60
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,120
I was just admiring it.  That's all.

61
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:25,610
You know.  Actually...

62
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:28,990
I'm thinking about getting me one of these myself.

63
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:32,480
You!  You don't have money for a car.

64
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,480
Maybe.

65
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,850
But I can buy you a coke.

66
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:40,350
Get on down here!

67
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:11,250
Who are you anyway?

68
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:13,750
Oh.

69
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:19,240
My name's .... Clide Barrow.

70
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,670
And I rob banks.

71
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:26,170
You do not!

72
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:33,140
What do you reckon this piece is for then?  Huh?

73
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,930
Wow!

74
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:40,430
See.

75
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:42,930
No!

76
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:46,910
Yeah baby.  You want to hold it?

77
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:48,690
I wanna hold it.

78
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,470
Touch it.

79
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:52,970
And shoot it!

80
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:56,890
You look mighty pretty with that

81
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:57,490
Thank you.

82
00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:01,710
But hey!  You wanna be careful...

83
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:05,660
...when you get hold of a hot piece like this.

84
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:09,250
It might just go off on you.

85
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:18,810
So a....

86
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:20,770
What do you wanna do?

87
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:23,270
You wanna spend the rest of your life...

88
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:25,260
...serving the country boys?

89
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:27,760
Bringing them their hash?

90
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:31,740
Letting them try to get their mits all over you?

91
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,310
Is that what you want?

92
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:34,330
No!

93
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:35,930
You want something better right?

94
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:40,120
You wanna life where you can look at the stars and say...

95
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,620
...you belong to me.

96
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:45,120
I want to be a star.

97
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:47,620
Wow!

98
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:50,120
Between you and me...

99
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:54,650
...and this.  We can make that happen.

100
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:04,750
Hey!

101
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,200
Loaded!

102
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:09,700
I surrender baby!

103
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:16,900
Now.  How about I show you some of those stars?

104
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:20,400
Yeahhh!

105
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:24,920
Oh Clide!

106
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:28,420
Hey.  Your momma ain't gonna come down is she?

107
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:29,710
I don't care.

108
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:32,390
well if you don't care.

109
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:34,930
Your momma wanna keep you a virgin or what?

110
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:37,100
I know!

111
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,690
Let's have a look at this.

112
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:41,230
Oh my god.

113
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:44,730
Is that some Texas ass or what?

114
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:50,360
You never gonna meet a preacher man like that!  Hop on here.

115
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,860
Now let's have a look.

116
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:57,360
...at what Miss Bonnie's got.

117
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:01,690
Oh boy!

118
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:09,920
Yeah.  Park it up there baby!

119
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:13,630
Let the sunlight right in.  Oh yeah!

120
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:31,870
You sure do taste sweet.

121
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:35,370
And what have you got for me?

122
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:40,670
I've got a whole lot of lovin' for you.

123
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:45,290
Get me out of these clothes!

124
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:48,790
You know what my favorite fruit is?

125
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:50,500
What?

126
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,740
Peaches.

127
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:56,620
And I got myself a whole barrel load here, I reckon!

128
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:00,090
Damn!

129
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:13,770
OK, it's a stick up!

130
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:17,270
Yeah!

131
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:22,460
Hey.  That ain't my only weapon, you know.

132
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:25,960
Oh.  Look at this weapon.

133
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:29,460
I always keep this one loaded.

134
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,040
Oh!  I don't wanna lose no buttons.

135
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:16,050
Take it all off!  I don't like clothes.

136
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:21,900
I gotta show you the kind of intensive investigation...

137
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:25,400
...that the Federal Bureau is doing these days.

138
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:31,970
They get into body searches, and all that nonsense.

139
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:35,800
You would not believe it.

140
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,590
Gotta long ways to go.

141
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:02,540
You just wait right there.

142
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:06,040
Hurry?  We ain't in now hurry.

143
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:56,200
Hey, that's how you like it, huh?

144
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,530
Oh yeah!

145
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:14,980
Oh yeah, Miss Parker!

146
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:25,810
Just don't let your momma see that!

147
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:37,880
OK.

148
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:44,660
I'll be drivin'.  You come ridin'.

149
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:46,600
Uh uh!

150
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:49,740
If I'm comin'...I'm drivin'.

151
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:52,260
That's how it is with Miss Bonnie Parker, see?

152
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:54,420
Get in!

153
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:56,700
OK Beauty.

154
00:43:58,230 --> 00:44:00,890
Wait for me now.  Let's go!

155
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,780
Marshall Frank Cameron sir?

156
00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:39,740
Of course!  Bring his ass on in here.

157
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:43,780
Frank my boy, you are in...Good to see you.

158
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:46,320
Have a seat.  Have a seat.

159
00:44:46,570 --> 00:44:51,510
So what is it you wanted to see me about?

160
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:54,870
Well, I hear you been doing a little freelancing on the side.

161
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:58,370
I figured you might be interested in a job that really pays.

162
00:44:58,370 --> 00:45:00,770
I'm listening.

163
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:04,210
Here's the deal.  A few of my branches are getting robbed.

164
00:45:04,210 --> 00:45:07,710
Times being as hard as they are,  i just can't afford it.

165
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:09,350
It's bad for business.

166
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:10,850
No I agree.

167
00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:14,710
I can surely see you are suffering, sir.

168
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:18,210
Heres  my problem right here.

169
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:21,710
Goes by the name Clide Barrow, ex-con.

170
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:26,780
Goddamn small town!  But I did have to lay off the security staff.

171
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:30,280
He's making me regret that decision.

172
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:33,780
OK, and you want me to take him down, I get it.

173
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:36,650
It's gonna be like looking for a needle in a haystack.

174
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:40,780
NOT EXACTLY YOU SEE.

175
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,620
I CAN OFFER YOU $1000 UP FRONT.

176
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:47,780
Then another $10,000 when it's all over.

177
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:48,880
Man!

178
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,900
Do we have a deal?  Deal.

179
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:53,730
That's what I like to hear, Frank, by boy.

180
00:45:53,730 --> 00:45:56,160
Always sharp as a tack.

181
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,380
I knew we could come to terms.

182
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:01,550
Excuse me sir.

183
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:09,210
Yes Janie.  Would you please be so kind as to send in tonight's entertainment?

184
00:46:09,210 --> 00:46:12,170
Thank you very much.

185
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:13,410
Scotch?

186
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:15,700
Don't mind if I do.

187
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:19,200
Help yourself partner.

188
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:25,030
Ladies, come on in.

189
00:46:25,030 --> 00:46:27,560
I'd like you to meet my boy, Frank Hamer.

190
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:29,740
Go say hello.

191
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:33,240
Hey you're gonna like it.

192
00:46:36,810 --> 00:46:39,580
A little celebration is in order.

193
00:46:49,350 --> 00:46:52,980
Would you help me with my sidearm?

194
00:46:57,210 --> 00:46:59,330
Be careful.

195
00:50:46,030 --> 00:50:49,990
You are so fucking good!

196
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:07,270
If feels so good sliding in there!

197
01:11:10,390 --> 01:11:13,430
Howdy.  How are you folks doing today?

198
01:11:13,430 --> 01:11:15,140
OK.

199
01:11:15,140 --> 01:11:17,390
What can I do you for?

200
01:11:17,390 --> 01:11:19,680
Just fill her on up.

201
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:21,800
Hey!  I've seen you.

202
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:23,390
No you ain't.

203
01:11:23,390 --> 01:11:25,760
Yeah...The papers.  You're the bank robber!

204
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:28,120
We don't want no trouble, OK?

205
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:31,620
Fill her on up and me and my gal will be on our way.

206
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:33,930
Trouble?  Hell, I want in!

207
01:11:33,930 --> 01:11:37,430
I'll even give you guys free gasoline if I can join your gang.

208
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:42,740
Hey Clide!  He could drive get-away for us.

209
01:11:42,740 --> 01:11:44,490
You can drive boy?

210
01:11:44,490 --> 01:11:47,660
Can I drive?  I can drive.  Mechanic.

211
01:11:47,660 --> 01:11:50,570
Handle a steel.  I can do it all.

212
01:11:50,570 --> 01:11:54,070
What other surprises you got?

213
01:11:54,070 --> 01:11:56,630
I have lots of favorites.

214
01:11:56,630 --> 01:12:01,090
You'd be surprised what people are willing to do for free gasoline.

215
01:12:01,090 --> 01:12:05,720
You know, they say by the end of summer gasoline should be about 12 cents.

216
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:08,210
12 cents!

217
01:12:08,210 --> 01:12:12,610
Ain't nobody ever paid no 12 cents for gasoline!

218
01:12:13,450 --> 01:12:17,580
We get pretty much everything for fee, don't we?

219
01:12:18,490 --> 01:12:21,260
Now then, what's your name?

220
01:12:21,260 --> 01:12:25,570
CW. CW!  Pleasure to meet you.  Indeed.

221
01:12:25,570 --> 01:12:27,890
And this here is...

222
01:12:27,890 --> 01:12:29,940
Miss Bonnie Parker!

223
01:12:29,940 --> 01:12:31,300
Oh wow!

224
01:12:31,300 --> 01:12:34,800
The sexiest bank robber...

225
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:36,150
...in the West!

226
01:12:36,150 --> 01:12:39,650
I have to agree with that.  Ain't it true.

227
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:44,350
Sorry.  I'm a little bit...

228
01:12:46,580 --> 01:12:48,390
Clide you gotta stop doing that.

229
01:12:52,070 --> 01:12:54,630
Nice to meet you.  My pleasure.

230
01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:57,770
Don't take too long.  You know I hate waiting.

231
01:12:57,770 --> 01:12:58,720
Oh Honey.

232
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:00,800
We won't be long.

233
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:04,300
Business can't take that long.

234
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:05,570
Anyway.

235
01:13:05,630 --> 01:13:08,890
Behave.

236
01:13:10,340 --> 01:13:11,860
Hey.

237
01:13:11,860 --> 01:13:14,660
Wanna come see what I got?

238
01:13:14,660 --> 01:13:18,160
Yeah.

239
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:21,240
I'm feeling mighty in the mood.

240
01:13:22,860 --> 01:13:24,740
Come on boy.

241
01:13:24,740 --> 01:13:26,630
You'll like this bit of business.

242
01:13:30,110 --> 01:13:32,020
Woo Hooo!

243
01:13:34,170 --> 01:13:36,240
Who's your friend?

244
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:38,470
This is Clide I'd like to introduce you to.

245
01:13:38,470 --> 01:13:40,430
My name is Clide Barrow.

246
01:13:40,430 --> 01:13:41,540
Pleased to meet you.

247
01:13:53,690 --> 01:13:56,640
I do declare this place open for business.

248
01:14:00,730 --> 01:14:03,960
You guys get started here.  I'll get my boots off.

249
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:08,800
You guys are spoiling me today.

250
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:12,300
He's so funny.

251
01:14:23,270 --> 01:14:26,770
It's so lonely by ourselves.

252
01:14:26,770 --> 01:14:30,270
Ain't that a shame.

253
01:14:38,380 --> 01:14:40,750
Thank you kindly.

254
01:14:40,750 --> 01:14:43,140
We got business to tend to.

255
01:14:43,140 --> 01:14:46,640
Business ... for sure.

256
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:03,170
What about you?

257
01:15:13,830 --> 01:15:16,870
Serving the first course!

258
01:21:01,030 --> 01:21:02,050
You know what?

259
01:21:02,050 --> 01:21:05,550
I'm going to show you an old trick.

260
01:21:19,070 --> 01:21:21,190
Oh no!  Is that going to work?

261
01:21:25,470 --> 01:21:29,610
Oh yeah, Texas Momma!  Let's see you get up on there.

262
01:21:31,210 --> 01:21:34,120
It's what we call the Texas soda fountain.

263
01:21:47,550 --> 01:21:50,930
You ride it.  I ride it.

264
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:57,030
Keep riding it 'til your throwed off.

265
01:42:40,270 --> 01:42:42,670
CW!

266
01:44:32,130 --> 01:44:35,820
Did I say, I was going to make you a star?

267
01:44:35,820 --> 01:44:37,970
You sure did, Clide.

268
01:44:37,970 --> 01:44:43,470
Now Darling, you got your pistol, we got a bunch of cash...

269
01:44:43,470 --> 01:44:46,190
Why don't we have a party in here?

270
01:44:47,860 --> 01:44:50,190
Sugar plum he just sang the right note.

271
01:44:52,060 --> 01:44:54,440
Let's do it!

272
01:45:25,450 --> 01:45:27,260
Detective Hamer please.

273
01:45:30,250 --> 01:45:34,440
I think I know where that sexy bank robber is you're looking for.

274
01:45:34,440 --> 01:45:36,920
If you're interested.

275
01:47:15,370 --> 01:47:19,100
I want to taste that cock after it's been inside your pussy, OK?

276
01:47:19,100 --> 01:47:21,870
Yeah.  Let me taste that cock.

277
01:47:42,740 --> 01:47:45,620
Now that is country loving!

278
01:47:47,030 --> 01:47:49,520
What's going on in here?

279
01:48:23,470 --> 01:48:25,480
Let me have that cock in my mouth.

280
01:50:22,450 --> 01:50:25,610
That is a party right there!

281
01:52:20,040 --> 01:52:22,170
Ooohh yes!  Give me that dick!

282
01:52:26,640 --> 01:52:29,640
I'm sure glad you got me to work today.

283
01:52:29,640 --> 01:52:32,500
You know, I was going to have the day off.

284
01:52:37,410 --> 01:52:40,220
You want to put those fingers deep inside my pussy?

285
02:04:48,310 --> 02:04:56,240
Bonnie.  Hey Bonnie.  You going to be the star of the show?

286
02:04:56,240 --> 02:04:58,570
Keep fucking me just like that.

287
02:10:55,440 --> 02:10:59,800
Give me that big cum load!

288
02:11:26,320 --> 02:11:28,630
Squirt it all over me.

289
02:13:06,070 --> 02:13:08,210
You greedy girl!

290
02:13:08,210 --> 02:13:11,710
I'm going to get you a cocktail.
